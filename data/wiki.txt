The Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal, also known as U.S. Arsenal Building, is a building located in MacArthur Park in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. Built in, it was part of Little Rock s first military installation. Since its decommissioning, The Tower Building has housed two museums. It was home to the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities from to and the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History since. It has also been the headquarters of the Little Rock sthetic Club since. Perhaps because Abraham Lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as President, Captain Totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops. He agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions The governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the United States. The soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war. The soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders, not as conquered and surrendering soldiers. On the morning of February, Rector and Totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials. That afternoon, the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with Governor Rector at its head. All of the federal troops had left at this point, except Totten who had stayed behind to listen to the Governor s speech and to hand the arsenal over in person. The Little Rock Arsenal was classified in as an arsenal of deposit, meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis. Thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs, nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the Arsenal fell into State hands. Most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the Arkansas Military Board. M. cal flintlock, M. cal percussion converted Hall s rifles flintlock, Total, buck ball cartridges percussion, buck ball cartridges flint rounds, pounder ball shot ammunition packing boxes, shotguns and rifles repaired mostly for troops in service pistols repaired mostly for troops in service gun carriages Performed Guard, office, and police duties. Except for sthetic Club meetings, the Tower Building remained largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration. The sthetic Club provided much needed financial support during the period and even paid the electric bill during the Great Depression. The sthetic Club is still headquartered in the Tower Building. The arsenal was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in. Due to its association with the Camden Expedition of, the arsenal may be included in the Camden Expedition Sites National Historic Landmark designated in. Barker was a devout Anglican, and donated her artworks to Christian fundraisers and missionary organizations. She produced a few Christian themed books such as The Children s Book of Hymns and, in collaboration with her sister Dorothy, He Leadeth Me. She designed a stained glass window for St. Edmund s Church, Pitlake, and her painting of the Christ Child, The Darling of the World Has Come, was purchased by Queen Mary. Barker took correspondence courses in art, probably until about. In at years, she entered an evening class at the Croydon School of Art, and attended the school into the s. In time, she received a teaching position. In, Raphael Tuck Sons bought four of Barker s little drawings for half a sovereign, and published them as postcards. In October, she won second prize in the Croydon Art Society s poster competition, and shortly afterward was elected the youngest member of the Society. The art critic for the Croydon Advertiser remarked, Her drawings show a remarkable freedom of spirit. She has distinct promise. In the late s, Barker began to doubt she was doing enough for the church and considered focusing solely on sacred works. Family and friends recommended she continue secular and sacred works, which she did. In, the Barker s live in maid retired, and Dorothy Barker closed her school at the back of the house in The Waldrons. She continued to supervise the household, and to give both her mother and sister the care they needed. Dorothy and her sister collaborated upon only two books Our Darling s First Book and the Christian themed, He Leadeth Me. In Dorothy Barker died of a heart attack. Barker was unable to pursue her art to any significant extent following her sister s death, as all the care of her aged mother devolved upon her, but she did manage to begin planning a stained glass window design in her sister s memory for St. Edmund s, Pitlake.

The team, however, has not competed in a match recognised by FIFA, the sport s international governing body, despite that organised women s football has been played in the country since. The Gambia has two youth teams, an under side that has competed in FIFA U Women s World Cup qualifiers, and an under side that withdrew from regional qualifiers for an under World Cup. The development of a national team faces challenges similar to those across Africa, although the national football association has four staff members focusing on women s football. In, few countries had women s national football teams. While the sport gained popularity worldwide in later decades, the Gambia s national team only played its first game in. That game was not FIFA recognised. As of March, the team was unranked by FIFA, and as of the following month the Gambia had not played in a FIFA sanctioned match. The team has not participated in major regional and international tournaments, including the Women s World Cup, the African Women s Championship or the All Africa Games. The Gambia also has an under team that was to play in the African Women s U Championship in. The Gambia s first match was against Morocco, but the team withdrew from the competition. Gambia s national football association was founded in, and became affiliated with FIFA in. Football is the most popular women s sport in the country, and was first played in an organized system in. A national competition was launched in, the same year FIFA started an education course on football for women. Competition was active on both the national and scholastic levels by. There are four staffers dedicated to women s football in the Gambia Football Association, and representation of women on the board is required by the association s charter. The Blue Jackets began the year with the worst start in franchise history and the worst by any team in an NHL season in years. After an start, Head Coach Scott Arniel was fired and replaced by Assistant Coach Todd Richards. The poor season prompted several personnel changes including the trade of All Star forward Jeff Carter, who was acquired with much fanfare during the off season. With the prospect of another rebuild looming the Blue Jackets captain and best player, Rick Nash, requested to be traded, though he would remain with the team for the entire season. The team was involved in a controversial loss to the Los Angeles Kings, when the Staples Center clock appeared to freeze at. seconds allowing the Kings time to score the tying goal, before winning in overtime. During the season Columbus managed only two winning streaks of three or more games. One of which came towards the end of the year helping the Blue Jackets finish with points, the third worst point total in franchise history. Columbus started March with a shutout against the Colorado Avalanche. They proceeded to win their next game against the Phoenix Coyotes, which marked the first time that the Blue Jackets posted back to back regulation victories during the season. Columbus again defeated the Coyotes three days later to earn their first three game win streak of the season. They extended the streak to four with a win over the Los Angeles Kings before it came to an end with a loss to the St. Louis Blues. It was the only four game win streak of the season for the Blue Jackets. They immediately matched their four game win streak with a four game losing streak and with ten games remaining, the Blue Jackets were the first team eliminated from playoff contention. Shortly after being eliminated, they were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers the loss clinched last place in the NHL for Columbus. It was the first time in franchise history the Blue Jackets finished in th place. A month later, on May, the Blue Jackets announced that Richards would remain as head coach and signed him to a two year contract. During the press conference, Howson noted, Our team continuously improved under Todd and he has earned the opportunity to build upon the work he started. Columbus posted an record under Richards, including winning seven of their final games.

Jacqueline Fernandez born August is a Sri Lankan actress, former model, and the winner of the Miss Universe Sri Lanka pageant. As Miss Universe Sri Lanka she represented her country at the world Miss Universe pageant. She graduated with a degree in mass communication from the University of Sydney, and worked as a television reporter in Sri Lanka. Barry John Cullen born August, is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played in the National Hockey League NHL for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning. He was a standout player for Boston University and is the school s all time leading scorer. After the Buffalo Sabres selected him in the NHL Supplemental Draft but chose not to offer him a contract, Cullen signed with the Flint Spirits of the International Hockey League IHL for the season where he was named the IHL s co Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player after leading the league in scoring. His career was halted in when he was diagnosed with Non Hodgkin lymphoma. He attempted a brief comeback in after an month battle with the disease, for which the NHL awarded him the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, before retiring to serve as an assistant coach for a year with the Lightning. Cullen played in two NHL All Star Games in his career. He joined his brother in the car dealership business after leaving the game, and briefly operated his own dealership until forced to close during the automotive industry crisis of. He idolized his elder brother Terry, who was considered a top NHL prospect until Terry s career was ended when he suffered a broken neck after being hit from behind into the boards during a college game. While his brother was highly sought by American universities, John received only two scholarship offers, choosing to play for Boston University BU in. Cullen made his NHL debut in, appearing in games with the Penguins and scoring points. He was given a greater role with the Penguins the following year after Mario Lemieux missed games due to a back injury and responded by scoring goals and points to finish third in team scoring. Additionally, he played for Team Canada at the World Championship, scoring four points in ten games. Cullen had his best season in. As one of the team s top offensive centres, he scored points in the Penguins first games and played in his first NHL All Star Game. However, when Lemieux returned after missing an additional games due to injury, Cullen s playing time and production declined. Cullen is the namesake of the John Cullen Award, previously given to key IHL players. Near the end of World War I, the Erzherzog Karl class battleships were handed over to the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs but Erzherzog Ferdinand Max was later transferred to Great Britain as a war reparation. She was later broken up for scrap in. The gods were believed to have many names. Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others. To know the true name of a deity was to have power over it. The importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power. Although the Egyptians believed their gods to be present in the world around them, contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances. In literature, gods may appear to humans in a physical form, but in real life the Egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication. Temples, where the state rituals were carried out, were filled with images of the gods. The most important temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary. These statues were usually less than life size, and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods bodies. Many temples had several sanctuaries, each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad. The city s primary god was envisioned as its lord, employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented. The gods residing in the temples of Egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon. But many deities including some important gods as well as those that were minor or hostile were never given temples of their own, although some were represented in the temples of other gods. Egyptian gods were involved in human lives as well as in the overarching order of nature. This divine influence applied mainly to Egypt, as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order. But in the New Kingdom, when other nations were under Egyptian control, foreigners were said to be under the sun god s benign rule in the same way that Egyptians were. Official religious practices, which maintained maat for the benefit of all Egypt, were related to, but distinct from, the religious practices of ordinary people, who sought the gods help for their personal problems. South of Heaven is the fourth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on July, the album was the band s second collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose production skills on Slayer s previous album Reign in Blood had helped the band s sound evolve. South of Heaven was Slayer s second album to enter the Billboard, and its last to be released by Def Jam Recordings, although the album became an American Recordings album after Rick Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. It was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros. Records because of original distributor Columbia Records refusal to release work by the band. The release peaked at number and in was awarded a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his most lackluster. King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as probably the odd man out at that point, he admitted he didn t participate as much because of that. Hanneman said We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell. King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and added too much singing. Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that s me personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else. Tom Araya bass, lead vocals Jeff Hanneman lead and rhythm guitar Kerry King lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals Dave Lombardo drums Of the, civil aircraft registered in the UK, per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between. and. million hours flown. The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, but the main area of growth over the last years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft, such as microlights, amateur built aeroplanes, and smaller helicopters. There are, Private Pilot Licence holders, and, certified glider pilots. Some of the, pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than, aerodromes and landing sites, ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips, over per cent of GA activity is conducted at of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs, people, and contributes. billion to the UK economy. GA is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority CAA, although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the European Aviation Safety Agency EASA. The main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing, and the objective is to promote high standards of safety. At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies, and gliding is in transition from a self regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA. Airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted. The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector, and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of GA public transport operations, and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market. The planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome related environmental issues which, particularly regarding noise, are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at GA. The International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO defines general aviation GA as an aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport operation or an aerial work operation. It defines commercial air transport CAT as an aircraft operation involving the transport of passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or hire, and aerial work as an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, construction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, search and rescue, aerial advertisement, etc. Private flying can be for both recreational purposes and personal transport, using aircraft that are owned individually, collectively as part of a syndicate, or rented from a flying club. A survey of pilots conducted between and indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near the base aerodrome, visits to other aerodromes, and day trips away. Half of all flights landed at the same aerodrome they departed from, and only per cent involved an overnight stay away from home. There are an estimated, civil aircraft registered in the UK, per cent of which are engaged in GA activities. In the GA fleet comprised, fixed wing aircraft, microlights, helicopters, airships balloons, gliders and some, hang gliders. Estimates put the number of foreign registered GA aircraft based in the UK at. The sector was estimated to employ nearly, people and directly contribute. billion to the UK economy in, making it roughly seven per cent of the size of the CAT industry. Nearly half of the economic contribution was generated by business aviation. Business aviation has shown strong growth, although the numbers of aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign registered business jets based in the UK, which are estimated to be growing in numbers. However, twin piston engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather. There were fatal accidents involving GA aircraft in, resulting in the loss of lives. These compare with accidents claiming a total of lives the previous year, and although the statistics are higher than average, they are not exceptional. Airspace is shared by CAT, military and GA users. It is divided into controlled airspace, in which aircraft must always be under the control of an air traffic controller, and uncontrolled airspace, in which aircraft can operate autonomously. Although GA flights can under certain conditions enter controlled airspace, they operate mainly outside of it. The ship s primary armament consisted of four. cm in caliber guns in two twin gun turrets. This was augmented by a heavy secondary battery of eight cm. in guns in four wing turrets. The tertiary battery consisted of twenty cm L guns in casemated single mounts, four mm. in L and one mm L quick firing guns. Furthermore, the ship s boats were equipped with two mm. in landing guns for operations shore. Three cm. in torpedo tubes were also carried, one on each broadside and one in the stern. The fungus is found in Europe from where it was originally described, and is widespread throughout North America. The North American distribution extends north to Alaska. In, it was reported for the first time from Turkey. The gold dollar or gold one dollar piece was a coin struck as a regular issue by the United States Bureau of the Mint from to. The coin had three types over its lifetime, all designed by Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre. The Type issue had the smallest diameter of any United States coin ever minted. In proposing his plan for a mint and a coinage system, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton in proposed that the one dollar denomination be struck both as a gold coin, and as one of silver, representative of the two metals which he proposed be made legal tender. Congress followed Hamilton s recommendation only in part, authorizing a silver dollar, but no coin of that denomination in gold. In, the first gold dollar was minted, at the private mint of Christopher Bechtler in North Carolina. Much of the gold then being produced in the United States came from the mountains of North Carolina and Georgia, and the dollars and other small gold coins issued by Bechtler circulated through that region, and were now and then seen further away. Additional one dollar pieces were struck by August Bechtler, Christopher s son. The gold dollar had a brief resurrection during the period of Early United States commemorative coins. Between and nine different issues were produced, with a total mintage of,. These were minted for various public events, did not circulate, and none used Longacre s design. The degree of reversibility in the initial step and therefore the diastereoselectivity depends on four factors, with greater reversibility corresponding to higher selectivity The Treaty of Ciudad Jurez was a peace treaty signed between the then President of Mexico, Porfirio Daz, and the revolutionary Francisco Madero on May,. The treaty put an end to the fighting between forces supporting Madero and those of Daz and thus concluded the initial phase of the Mexican Revolution. As early as March, Madero s representatives met in New York with Daz s finance minister, Jos Yves Limantour, and the Mexican ambassador to the US in order to discuss the possibility of peace between the two sides. Limantour proposed an end to the hostilities and offered an amnesty for all revolutionaries, the resignation of the then vice president Ramn Corral, the replacement of four Daz cabinet ministers and ten state governors by ones chosen by Madero, and the establishment of the principle of no reelection which would prevent Daz from seeking yet another term as president which would have been his ninth. Madero responded positively although he also stated that any kind of peace deal had to include an immediate resignation by Daz. At the same time there was also disagreement among the rebels. The left wing of the revolutionary movement, represented by Zapata and Orozco Villa for the time being tended to support Madero, warned against any possible compromises with Daz. In the end their suspicions proved correct as the treaty that was eventually signed neglected issues of social and agrarian land reform that were central to their struggle. The most significant point of the treaty was that Porfirio Daz, and his vice president, Ramn Corral, resign and that de la Barra, acting as interim president organize free elections as soon as possible. Additionally, the treaty stipulated that Madero and his supporters had the right to name fourteen provisional state governors, and to approve la Barra s cabinet. The treaty was signed on May. Daz resigned accordingly on May. Francisco de la Barra became the interim president. Madero entered Mexico City on June. The Feast of the Goat received largely positive reviews, with several reviewers commenting on the book s depiction of the relationship between sexuality and power, and on the graphic descriptions of violent events. The novel s narrative is divided into three distinct strands. One is centred on Urania Cabral, a fictional Dominican character another deals with the conspirators involved in Trujillo s assassination and the third focuses on Trujillo himself. The novel alternates between these storylines, and also jumps back and forth from to, with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in Trujillo s regime. In the novel s final chapters, the three storylines intersect with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of the SIM, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo s most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island. Many of the assassins had belonged to the Trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters, only to find their support for him eroded by the state s crimes against its people. Imbert, one of the assassins, sums up this realization in a comment prompted by the murder of the Mirabal sisters They kill our fathers, our brothers, our friends. And now they re killing our women. And here we sit, resigned, waiting our turn. In an interview, Vargas Llosa describes the corruption and brutality of Trujillo s regime He had more or less all the common traits of a Latin American dictator, but pushed to the extreme. In cruelty, I think he went far far away from the rest and in corruption, too. Trujillo s attempted sexual conquest of Urania is an example of both political manipulation of Agustn Cabral and sexual power over young women. However, as Trujillo s penis remains flaccid throughout the encounter and he is humiliated in front of the young girl, the encounter fails to satisfy his requirements for machismo. The realist style of The Feast of the Goat is recognized by some reviewers as being a break from a more allegorical approach to the dictator novel. The novel received largely positive reviews, most of which were willing to accept sacrifices of historical accuracy in favour of good storytelling.

Elephanta caves are a network of sculpted caves located on Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri literally the city of caves in Mumbai Harbour, kilometres. mi to the east of the city of Mumbai in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The island, located on an arm of the Arabian Sea, consists of two groups of caves the first is a large group of five Hindu caves, the second, a smaller group of two Buddhist caves. The Hindu caves contain rock cut stone sculptures, representing the Shaiva Hindu sect, dedicated to the Lord Shiva. The rock cut architecture of the caves has been dated to between the th and th centuries, although the identity of the original builders is still a subject of debate. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. All the caves were also originally painted in the past, but now only traces remain. The main cave Cave, or the Great Cave was a Hindu place of worship until Portuguese rule began in, after which the caves suffered severe damage. This cave was renovated in the s after years of neglect, and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in to preserve the artwork. It is currently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India ASI. The island has two groups of caves in the rock cut architectural style. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. All caves were painted in the past, but only traces remain. The larger group of caves, which consists of five caves on the western hill of the island, is well known for its Hindu sculptures. The primary cave, numbered as Cave, is about. km. mi up a hillside, facing the ocean. It is a rock cut temple complex that covers an area of, m, sq ft, and consists of a main chamber, two lateral chambers, courtyards, and subsidiary shrines. It is metres ft deep from the front entrance to the back. The temple complex is the abode of Shiva, depicted in widely celebrated carvings which reveal his several forms and acts. On the eastern part of the island, on the Stupa Hill, there is a small group of caves that house Buddhist monuments. This hill is named after the religious Stupa monument that they display. One of the two caves is incomplete, while the other contains a Stupa made in brick. The main cave blends Chalukyan architectural features such as massive figures of the divinities, guardians, and square pillars with custom capitals with Gupta artistic characteristics, like the depiction of mountains and clouds and female hairstyles. The carving on the south wall to the east of the portico depicts Shiva and Parvati seated on their abode Mount Kailash. The four armed Shiva is seen with a crown and a disc behind it all damaged, the sacred thread across his chest, and a dressing gown covering up to the knee. Parvati, dressed in her finery with her hair falling to the front, looks away. Behind her at the right is a woman attendant holding the child, identified with her son Kartikeya, the war god. Many male and female attendants are seen behind the main figures. Shiva s attendant, the skeleton like Bhringi, is seated at his feet. Other figures, not distinct, depict, among others, a royal looking tall person, ascetics, a fat figure, a dwarf, a bull the mount of Shiva, features of a Garuda, and two monkeys. The scenic beauty of the mountain is sculpted with the sky background amidst heavenly beings showering flowers on Shiva Parvati. This scene is interpreted as a gambling scene, where Parvati is angry as Shiva cheats in a game of dice. Townsend s solo albums, a diverse mix of hard rock, progressive metal, ambient, and new age, have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In he formed the Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases.

The project began with a series of four albums, released from to, each written in a different style, and Townsend continues to record and tour under the new moniker. In, Century Media Records offered Townsend a contract to make some extreme albums. He agreed to a five album deal with the record label, and also provided much of the guitar work on the album Millennium and the album Hard Wired by Vancouver industrial band Front Line Assembly. Townsend began to record material under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He avoided using his real name at this point in career, looking for a fresh start after his high profile Vai gig. At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn t the best publicity to have, he later explained. I was playing somebody else s music and I was judged in respect to that music. Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, which was released in April. Shortly thereafter Townsend began putting together the next Devin Townsend Band record, with the working title Human. Townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to Alien. It s basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with Alien for a while. The album ended up being renamed Synchestra and was released in January. Townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in Synchestra, blending his trademark pop metal with influences from folk, polka, and Middle Eastern music. The final Strapping Young Lad album, The New Black, was released later in. The second entry, a commercial, yet heavy album called Addicted, was released in November and features lead vocals from Townsend and Dutch singer Anneke van Giersbergen. Brian Beav Waddell was recruited from the Devin Townsend Band to play bass. After writing ideas for over songs, Townsend stated he is finally going to finish the whole project, followed by the announcement the album will be released on October,. The recording process started in May, and the final project includes the album, a Ziltoid TV program and a live show, with a big graphic novel comic and a documentary. The album itself is a double album, with disc one being the main album and disc two featuring Devin Townsend Project material according to Townsend, the album s theme is Ziltoid against the world. The Devin Townsend Project disc is called Sky Blue and the Ziltoid disc is called Dark Matters. Townsend recently discussed at least a year long hiatus, beginning after the Z show taking place at the Royal Albert Hall on April,. During the indefinitely long break Townsend intends to recharge his batteries, get some inspiration and experiences and to see what the next chapter holds for him. Since the s, plans have been made to rebuild the synagogue in its original location. Due to various political circumstances, very limited progress has been made. Major disagreements exist between the government and Jewish organizations as to how much the latter should be involved in decisions about the reconstruction project, including proposed design and character of the new building. Construction began in and was completed the following year. The synagogue was officially consecrated on September, a ceremony attended by representatives of city and regional authorities, Zagreb public figures, and many citizens. It was the first prominent public building in Zagreb s lower town, and its architecture and scale aroused general admiration and praise. With the new synagogue, an organ was introduced into religious service. The small minority of Orthodox Jews found this change to be intolerable, and they began to hold their services separately, in rented rooms. In the earthquake, the synagogue suffered minor damage and was repaired the following year. After World War II, the vacant site of the former synagogue was used as a makeshift volleyball court. The volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building, constructed in. The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot, and a architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned into a parking lot, which it remains to this day. In and, the Jewish Community of Zagreb presented new plans for a, m, sq ft multi purpose Jewish center and synagogue in Praka Street. In June, the Home Office announced it would review the use of FITs during public order policing. The move was influenced by the discovery that information collected by FITs, included that which was unrelated to suspected crimes, for example recording who made speeches at demonstrations. Liberty brought a judicial review of the overt surveillance practices in May, which was decided in favour of the police, however the police were asked to clarify their evidence to the Court of Appeal, following an investigation by The Guardian newspaper. After deciding that the statute s subject matter necessitated the strict scrutiny approach, the District Court decided on June, that it was an unconstitutional violation of the right to vote for and select Senate candidates. This decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, who decided against the use of the strict scrutiny approach and, in its absence, ruled that the statute was not a violation of the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments. Academics have been critical of both the decision reached and the approach used, with one suggesting that the substantial state interests test used in Valenti v. Rockefeller would be more appropriate. Michael Jeffrey Jordan born February, also known by his initials, MJ, is an American retired professional basketball player. He is also a businessman, and principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets. Jordan played seasons in the National Basketball Association NBA for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. His biography on the NBA website states By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the s and s. Jordan s second season was cut short by a broken foot in the third game of the season, which caused him to miss games. Despite Jordan s injury and a record at the time it was fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history, the Bulls made the playoffs. Jordan recovered in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a Boston Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history, Jordan set the still unbroken record for points in a playoff game with in Game. The Celtics, however, managed to sweep the series. Jordan had recovered completely by the season, and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score, points in a season, averaging a league high. points on. shooting. In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record steals and blocks in a season. Despite Jordan s success, Magic Johnson won the league s Most Valuable Player Award. The Bulls reached wins, and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year. However, they were again swept by the Celtics. Jordan led the league in scoring again in the season, averaging. ppg on. shooting and won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the Defensive Player of the Year, as he had averaged. blocks and a league high. steals per game. The Bulls finished, and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan s career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. However, the Bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons, who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the Bad Boys. In the season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging. ppg on. shooting,. rpg, and. apg for the regular season. The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in years and set a franchise record with wins in the regular season. With Scottie Pippen developing into an All Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them. However, this time the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four game sweep. In an unusual ending to the fourth and final game, Isiah Thomas led his team off the court before the final seconds had concluded. Most of the Pistons went directly to their locker room instead of shaking hands with the Bulls. In his autobiography For the Love of the Game, Jordan wrote that he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of. The added exhaustion due to the Dream Team run in the Olympics solidified Jordan s feelings about the game and his ever growing celebrity status. Jordan s announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Despite his January claim that he was. certain that he would never play another NBA game, in the summer of Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback, this time with his new team. Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter, Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of in training, holding several invitation only camps for NBA players in Chicago. In addition, Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington s coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return. Playing in his th and final NBA All Star Game in, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul Jabbar as the all time leading scorer in All Star Game history a record since broken by Kobe Bryant. That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all games, starting in of them. He averaged. points,. rebounds,. assists, and. steals per game. He also shot from the field, and from the free throw line. Even though he turned during the season, he scored or more points times, or more points nine times, and or more points three times. On February, Jordan became the first year old to tally points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan s home games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most watched team in the NBA, averaging, fans a game at home and, on the road. However, neither of Jordan s final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. At several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of the number one draft pick in the NBA draft, Kwame Brown. Jordan s marked talent was clear from his rookie season. In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a prolonged standing ovation, a rarity for an opposing player. After Jordan scored a playoff record points against the Boston Celtics on April, Celtics star Larry Bird described him as God disguised as Michael Jordan. With five regular season MVPs tied for second place with Bill Russell only Kareem Abdul Jabbar has won more, six, six Finals MVPs NBA record, and three All Star MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player ever to play in the NBA. Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting a record times, and was named one of the Greatest Players in NBA History in. He is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal doing so twice with the and U.S. men s basketball teams. Although Jordan has done much to increase the status of the game, some of his impact on the game s popularity in America appears to be fleeting. Television ratings in particular increased only during his time in the league, and Finals ratings have not returned to the level reached during his last championship winning season. Jordan s private jet features a stripe in Carolina blue, the Air Jordan logo on the tail, and references to his career in the identification number. In June, Jordan was ranked by Forbes magazine as the th most powerful celebrity in the world with million earned between June and June. According to the Forbes article, Jordan Brand generates billion in sales for Nike. In June, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from to.. On January, Jordan was honored with the Charlotte Business Journal s Business Person of the Year for. As of November, his current net worth is estimated at. billion by Forbes. Jordan is the second richest African American in the world as of. In Poland ceased to exist as an sovereign nation and throughout the th century remained partitioned by degrees between Prussian, Austrian and Russian empires. Not until the end of World War I was independence restored and the nation reunited, although the drawing of boundary lines was, of necessity, a contentious issue. Independent Poland lasted for only years before it was again attacked and divided among foreign powers. Many places of learning and culture universities, schools, libraries, museums, theaters and cinemas were either closed or designated as Nur fr Deutsche For Germans Only. Twenty five museums and a host of other institutions were destroyed during the war. According to one estimate, by war s end of the infrastructure of Poland s educational and research institutions and of its museums had been destroyed. According to another, only of pre war Poland s museums survived the war, and just of these institutions were able to reopen. Of pre war Poland s scientific institutions, about half were totally destroyed, and only a few survived the war relatively intact. The state of Polish primary schools was somewhat better in the General Government, though by the end of, only of prewar schools were operational, and only of prewar Polish children attended them. A German police memorandum of August described the situation as follows The lead vessel of the class, INS Arihant was launched in and after extensive sea trials, was confirmed as ready for operations on February. Arihant is the first ballistic missile submarine to have been built by a country other than one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Along with her three sister ships, Knig, Grosser Kurfrst, and Kronprinz, Markgraf took part in most of the fleet actions during the war, including the Battle of Jutland on May and June. At Jutland, Markgraf was the third ship in the German line and heavily engaged by the opposing British Grand Fleet she sustained five large caliber hits and her crew suffered casualties. Markgraf also participated in Operation Albion, the conquest of the Gulf of Riga, in late. The ship was damaged by a mine while en route to Germany following the successful conclusion of the operation. After Germany s defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice in November, Markgraf and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles. On June, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Unlike most of the scuttled ships, Markgraf was never raised for scrapping the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay. She was armed with ten. cm. in SK L guns arranged in five twin gun turrets two superfiring turrets each fore and aft and one turret amidships between the two funnels. Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen cm. in SK L quick firing guns, six. cm. in SK L quick firing guns and five cm in underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. Markgraf s. cm guns were removed and replaced with four. cm anti aircraft guns. The ship s main armored belt was millimeters in thick. The deck was mm. in thick the main battery turrets and forward conning tower were armored with mm in thick steel plates. Following her commissioning on October, Markgraf conducted sea trials, which lasted until December. By January, the ship had joined III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet with her three sister ships. On January, III Squadron was detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver, gunnery, and torpedo training in the Baltic. The ships returned to the North Sea on February, too late to assist the I Scouting Group at the Battle of Dogger Bank. Around, several British destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the German line. Markgraf initially held her fire as the identities of the destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfrst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine. Markgraf was never raised for scrapping, unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled. Markgraf and her two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships, which made any salvage attempt more difficult. The outbreak of World War II in put a halt to all salvage operations, and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical. The rights to future salvage operations on the wrecks were sold to Britain in. Owing to the fact that the steel that composed their hulls was produced before the advent of nuclear weapons, Markgraf and her sisters are among the few accessible sources of low background steel, which has occasionally been removed for use in scientific devices. Markgraf and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks. Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead, and though sometimes constructed out of timber, many were built using large stones, now known as megaliths. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interned in collective burials with other members of their community. The construction of these collective burial monumental tombs, both wooden and megalithic, began in continental Europe before being adopted in Britain in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. They can be divided into two separate clusters one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between and km. The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Kit s Coty House, Little Kit s Coty House, the Coffin Stone, and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage. It had been built using about stones. The barrow is sub rectangular in plan, and about meters feet in length. At its broader, eastern end, where the chamber is located, the monument measures metres feet, while at the narrower, western end, it is metres feet in breadth. As such, the barrow is a truncated wedge shape. The megalithic builders responsible for the Coldrum Stones positioned it on the top of a small ridge adjacent to the North Downs, and constructed it facing eastward, towards the River Medway. The chamber of the monument measures. metres feet in length, and. metres feet inches in width, although it was potentially much larger when originally constructed. The chamber s internal height would have been at least metres feet inches. In its current state, the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs, one being feet long, feet, inches deep, and foot, inches thick, and the other feet long, feet deep, and feet thick. Conversely, the chamber s southern side consists of a single slab, measuring feet, inches in length, feet, inches in depth, and foot, inches in depth at its thicker, eastern end. The western end of the chamber is closed off with a slab measuring about feet, inches wide, with a thickness of foot and a depth of around feet. A collapsed, broken slab lies at the opening eastern end of the chamber. It is also possible that a largely rectangular slab at the bottom of the slope had once been part of the eastern end of the chamber. Excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens twentieth century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement, allowing the stones to continue standing upright. Little is known about her activities after the end of the war other than she was redesignated as a training ship on May. She was sunk as a target ship by SS N missiles on November. Route, also known as the Colonel Rodman Highway, is a. mile. km long numbered state highway located in Washington County and southern Kent County, Rhode Island, United States. The route is a major north south freeway in the southern Providence metropolitan area, directly linking Providence with eastern Washington County, the beaches of Narragansett and South Kingstown, and the city of Newport. Route begins as a two lane divided highway at an intersection with U.S. Route US in the town of North Kingstown, becoming a limited access freeway after. miles. km. The route has four numbered interchanges before terminating in the city of Warwick, where the northbound lanes merge into Interstate I. The origins of Route date back to, when construction began on a short, unnumbered arterial from US to the modern location of exit at Routes and in Wickford. In, the Rhode Island Department of Public Works began work on a. mile. km freeway from modern exit north to the merge with I. The freeway, designated as Route, was completed in. At that time, the Route designation was also applied to the Wickford arterial. In, the missing link in Route between exits and was completed and opened. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation has long term plans to upgrade the southernmost portion of Route to freeway status by constructing overpasses at Oak Hill Road and West Allenton Road and a grade separation with US. Although the project was originally scheduled to be completed by, the million project has been postponed indefinitely. In, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a million equivalent to million in bond issue to fund the construction of a mile. km, four lane divided arterial bypass of U.S. Route in Wickford. Construction on the highway began in and was completed in, at which time the roadway opened as an unnumbered state highway leading from US to Routes and in Wickford. Construction of a. mile. km long section of Route from what is now exit in East Greenwich to I in Warwick began in and was completed in. That year, the mile. km arterial south of the modern exit was also designated as part of Route. The divided highway remains largely intact to this date as the stretch of Route from US to Routes and at exit the only piece of the arterial that has been significantly altered is the construction of a bridge over Amtrak s Northeast Corridor line. By the early s, Route was complete north of exit and south of what would become exit, but there was a still a missing piece in the highway between the two exits. In the s, the state of Rhode Island faced several budget problems and environmental concerns, both of which delayed the construction of the missing link for nearly eleven years. Environmental studies on the missing link began in, and the state estimated that the. mile. km long section of freeway would cost million equivalent to million in to construct. In, construction began on the Quonset Freeway, a relocated Route that serves the Quonset Business Park from Route. The project included the reconstruction and reworking of exit off Route, which was a southbound only exit serving both Route and Route when constructed. The exit was converted into a trumpet interchange with new ramps between Route, Route and Route and was completed in December, one year ahead of schedule. The project included the construction of a new northbound exit serving Route east. West End Girls is a song by British pop duo Pet Shop Boys. Written by Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, the song was released twice as a single. The song is influenced by hip hop music, with lyrics concerned with class and the pressures of inner city life which were inspired partly by T. S. Eliot s poem The Waste Land. It was generally well received by contemporary music critics and has been frequently cited as a highlight in the duo s career. The song was performed by Pet Shop Boys at the Summer Olympics closing ceremony and was included as part of the soundtrack of the game Grand Theft Auto V on the Non Stop Pop radio station. In, Neil Tennant met producer Bobby Orlando, while on an assignment in New York interviewing Sting for Smash Hits. After listening to some demos, Orlando offered to produce for the duo. In April, West End Girls was released, becoming a club hit in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and a minor dance hit in Belgium, and France, but was only available in the United Kingdom as a import. In March, after long negotiations, Pet Shop Boys cut their contractual ties with Orlando, and hired manager Tom Watkins, who signed them with EMI. They re recorded West End Girls with producer Stephen Hague, and re released the song in late, topping the charts in both the UK and the U.S. The lyric From Lake Geneva to the Finland Station refers to the train route taken by Vladimir Lenin when he was smuggled by the Germans to Russia during World War I, a pivotal event in the Russian Revolution. Indeed, it is highly likely the lyric was inspired by the book To the Finland Station by Edmund Wilson, a very famous work on the history of revolutionary thought and Socialism that Tennant would have at least heard of, if not read, as a student. The Bobby Orlando produced version of the single included another line, All your stopping, stalling and starting, Who do you think you are, Joe Stalin, which was removed for the version. In, West End Girls won for Best Single at The BRIT Awards, and for Best International Hit at the Ivor Novello Awards. In, the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters gave to West End Girls the Ivor Novello Award for Song of The Decade between the years and. Having signed with EMI, the group released their first major label single Opportunities Let s Make Lots of Money in mid, but it failed to attract attention. The Pet Shop Boys then decided to re record West End Girls, and issue this new version as a single. Producer Stephen Hague helmed the new, re recorded version of West End Girls. The re recorded version of West End Girls was released in the United Kingdom in October, debuting on the UK Singles Chart at number, and within eight weeks of its release it had reached the top of the chart. It maintained the number one position for two weeks and received a gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry BPI in January. Across Europe, West End Girls also topped the singles chart in Norway, as well as peaking in the top three in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. In Canada, where the original recording of West End Girls had already been a minor hit in, the re recorded version was issued as a single in early. The re recorded song entered the chart in March, peaking at number one for one week on May. In the United States, West End Girls debuted on the Billboard Hot at number, reaching the number one position on May, and remained on the chart for weeks. The song also peaked at number one on Billboard s Hot Dance Music Club Play chart for two weeks.

Production The Christmas nor easter was an intense cyclone along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. It developed from an area of low pressure in the southeast Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Keys, and moved across the state of Florida. As it entered the warm waters of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, it began to rapidly intensify, exhibiting traits of a tropical system, including the formation of an eye. It attained a pressure of millibars on December and, and after moving northward, it came ashore near New York City on Christmas Eve. Because of the uncertain nature of the storm, the National Hurricane Center NHC did not classify it as a tropical cyclone. Heavy rain from the developing storm contributed to significant flooding in South Carolina. Much of the rest of the East Coast was affected by high winds, coastal flooding, and beach erosion. New York State and New England bore the brunt of the storm damage was extensive on Long Island, and in Connecticut, households lost electric power during the storm. Widespread damage and power outages also occurred throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where the storm generated foot. m waves along the coast. Because of the warm weather pattern that contributed to the storm s development, precipitation was limited to rain. Two people were killed, and damage amounted to at least million. Damage was light in Maryland. Some sand dunes and wooden structures were damaged, and above normal tides occurred. In New Jersey, high winds caused power outages and knocked down trees and power lines. Minor coastal flooding of streets and houses was reported. Otherwise, damage in the state was minor.

Adam Stansfield September August was an English professional footballer who played as a striker. He competed professionally for Yeovil Town, Hereford United and Exeter City, and won promotion from the Football Conference to The Football League with all three teams. Stansfield was born in Plymouth, Devon, as the third of four children, and supported Nottingham Forest. On June he married Marie, with whom he had three sons. Devon journalist Gary Andrews remembered Stansfield as a man who would spend time with his family after matches while speaking to fans and the press. He wrote that I had the pleasure of interviewing Adam on a regular basis... I say pleasure, because his answers were thoughtful and intelligent and he came across as a man who was delighted to be back home with his friends and family. He recovered to feature in the next campaign, making his league debut on August. In that match, Yeovil s first in The Football League, he came on as an th minute substitute for Kirk Jackson in a win against Carlisle United. His first of six goals in the Third Division season came on September, opening a home win over Swansea City. He was given a rare start in that match as first choice forward Kevin Gall was away with Wales under. On June, with his contract expired, Stansfield decided to remain in the Conference, joining Exeter City. He told local radio that his aim was not to achieve promotion or reach a certain tally of goals, but to influence the club s younger players. On April, Stansfield scored in Exeter s draw at Burton Albion which qualified them for that season s play offs. He started in the final, whereby the team returned to The Football League for the first time in five years with a Wembley win over Cambridge United. As a mark of respect, Dagenham Redbridge postponed the game Exeter were due to play against them at Victoria Road four days after his death. Exeter retired his shirt number for nine seasons.

However, in September he was demoted to be Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Defense Ministry, while his rival, General Anupong Paochinda, was promoted to lead the Army. As a result, Saprang retired from the Army in. Saprang started his military career in as Rifle Platoon Leader in the rd Infantry Battalion, th Regimental Combat Team. He claims to have fought battles during the course of his military career. He was then promoted to be Regimental Commanding Officer of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School in. In, he began a six year stint as Regimental Commanding Officer of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy. Saprang noted in an interview that, if telecommunication businesses are in private hands, the country won t be safe. The junta had earlier announced plans to cancel the initial public offering of both TOT and CAT Telecom and to merge the two state enterprises. As Chairman of CAT Telecom, Saprang was accused by the founders of People s Television PTV, a new satellite television station, of being behind CAT Telecom s refusal to grant an internet link from Bangkok to a satellite up link station in Hong Kong. PTV was established by several ex executives of the Thai Rak Thai party. CAT Telecom claimed that it never received PTV s application for internet access. Under Saprang s leadership, subscribers of Thai Mobile, a TOT CAT joint venture mobile phone operator, were cut off temporarily in early May when owners TOT and CAT Telecom failed to pay the bills of a major supplier. Thai Mobile had accumulated significant losses and the company was not able to make its debt payments or supplier payments. The partners had stopped payments to the supplier, Samart Corporation, for nearly a year, until Samart threatened to suspend services within three days. After no payment, it delivered on its threat. TOT was subsequently able to negotiate with Samart to restart the service. As AoT Chairman, Saprang spearheaded an effort to reopen Don Muang Airport in parallel with the newly opened Suvarnabhumi Airport, despite objections from the Civil Aviation Department, airlines, and internal studies within Airports of Thailand. airlines threatened to halt flights to Thailand if they were forced to move back to Don Muang airport. The airport faced ongoing operational challenges, including a computer virus that shut down the automated luggage bomb scanning system in June. A study by the International Air Transport Association IATA released in July found the airport unsafe, citing numerous spots where checked passengers can meet people who have not passed through security checkpoints. The AoT board also granted million baht to the Army, which had requested a financial donation. AoT also lent some of its explosives detectors to the Army for use in the South Thailand insurrection. Saprang had long been a fierce critic of Thaksin Shinawatra, and prior to the coup had even called Thaksin s supporters within the military evil. After the coup, Saprang called Thaksin a traitor and said that he should be banished to live forever in the jungle. Saprang stands centimeters tall and as of March, weighed kilograms.

This meant York qualified for the play offs, and they were eliminated in the semi final by Fleetwood Town. York were knocked out of the FA Cup, Football League Cup and Football League Trophy in their opening round matches. York achieved their first home win in five matches after beating Exeter, with first half goals scored by McCombe and Coulson. Hayhurst s loan was extended to the end of the season, having impressed in his six appearances for the club. Coulson scored again with the only goal, a st minute header, in York s away win over AFC Wimbledon. Bowman scored the only goal with a nd minute penalty as York won away against Mansfield, in which Fletcher missed the opportunity to extend the lead when his stoppage time penalty was saved by Alan Marriott. York moved one place outside the play offs with a home win over Wycombe, courtesy of a second Bowman penalty in as many matches and a Carson goal from the edge of the penalty area. Coulson scored York s only goal in a away win over struggling Portsmouth with a low volley in the fifth minute this result meant York moved into the play offs in seventh place with eight fixtures remaining. Pope made a number of saves as York held league leaders Rochdale to a away draw, with a point being enough to lift the team back into seventh place. York were prevented from equalling a club record of eight consecutive clean sheets when Accrington scored a stoppage time equaliser in a home draw, in which York had taken earlier taken the lead with a Coulson penalty. A win away win over Oxford, which was decided by a second half Coulson penalty, resulted in York moving one place above their opponents and back into seventh place. York consolidated their place in a play off position after beating Bury at home with a fifth minute goal scored by Lowe from a Hayhurst corner.

Antimony compounds are often classified according to their oxidation state Sb III and Sb V. The oxidation state is more stable. Antimony trioxide Sb O is formed when antimony is burnt in air. In the gas phase, this compound exists as Sb O O can only be formed by oxidation by concentrated nitric acid. Antimony also forms a mixed valence oxide, antimony tetroxide Sb O forms upon fusing sodium oxide and Sb O Many antimony ores are sulfides, including stibnite Sb S., SbCl are all molecular compounds having trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry. is prepared by the reaction of Sb O with HF Sb O HF SbF H O It is Lewis acidic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions SbF is prepared by dissolving Sb S Sb S H S and SbCl. Antimony III sulfide, SbS, was recognized in predynastic Egypt as an eye cosmetic kohl as early as about BC, when the cosmetic palette was invented. The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, kohl, the sulfide of antimony. In, according to the US Geological Survey, China accounted for. of total antimony production with South Africa, Bolivia and Russia sharing the second place. Roskill estimates that secondary production globally in was, tonnes. Antimony was ranked first in a Risk List published by the British Geological Survey in the second half of. The list provides an indication of the relative risk to the supply of chemical elements or element groups required to maintain the current British economy and lifestyle. Also, antimony was identified as one of critical raw materials for the EU in a report published in, primarily due to the lack of supply outside China. The world s largest antimony producers, according to Roskill, are listed below According to statistics from the USGS, current global reserves of antimony will be depleted in years. However, the USGS expects more resources will be found. Sb S Sb O C Sb CO About of antimony is consumed in flame retardants, and is used in alloys for batteries, plain bearings and solders.

He had been considering a return to London for some time and eagerly agreed, taking on the post, which was based at Lancaster House in the St James s area, in July. In Wales, many felt that Wheeler had simply taken the directorship of the National Museum to advance his own career prospects, and that he had abandoned them when a better offer came along. Wheeler himself disagreed, believing that he had left Fox at the Museum as his obvious successor, and that the reforms he had implemented would therefore continue. The position initially provided Wheeler with an annual salary of, which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family, who moved into a flat near to Victoria Station. Wheeler had also become President of the Museums Association, and in a presidential address given in Belfast talked on the topic of preserving museum collections in war time, believing that Britain s involvement in a second European conflict was imminent. In anticipation of this event, in August he arranged for the London Museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Bristol University, and at the award ceremony met the Conservative Party politician Winston Churchill, who was then engaged in writing his multi volume A History of the English Speaking Peoples Churchill asked Wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval Britain, to which the latter agreed. Wheeler left Italy in November and returned to London. There, he resigned as the director of the London Museum and focused on organising the Institute of Archaeology, preparing it for its adoption of a new director, V. Gordon Childe, after the war. He also resigned as director of the Society of Antiquaries, but was appointed the group s representative to the newly formed Council for British Archaeology. He developed a relationship with a woman named Kim Collingridge, and asked her to marry him. As she was a devout Roman Catholic, he officially converted to the religion, something which shocked many of his friends, who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith. He then set sail for Bombay aboard a transport ship, the City of Exeter, in February. A. fragilis is the type species and was named by Marsh in. It is known from the remains of at least sixty individuals, all found in the Kimmeridgian Tithonian Upper Jurassic age Morrison Formation of the United States, spread across the states of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. Details of the humerus upper arm of A. fragilis have been used as diagnostic among Morrison theropods, but the discovery of A. jimmadseni indicates that this will no longer be the case at the species level. North American sources describe A. hygrometricus as being of either unknown edibility, or too tough to be edible. However, they are regularly consumed in Asia, including Nepal and South Bengal, where local people consume them as delicious food. They are collected from the wild and sold in the markets of India.

He had a stretch between July and August where he gave up just two earned runs and converted all save chances. Once again despite Nathan s numbers, he was not picked for the All Star team. Nathan finished the year by converting of save opportunities with a record of and an ERA of.. The Twins however had a disappointing season and missed the playoffs. Though Nathan was slated to make million in, on March, the Minnesota Twins re signed Nathan to a four year, million contract through.

Built in, it has been described as an outstanding example of the Romanesque Revival style of architecture. St. Leonard s parish, named after Saint Leonard of Port Maurice, was organized in. A wood frame church was built in on the outskirts of Madison, and moved into the city in. In, the basement of the current church was built, and the congregation moved into it, converting the old church to a school. When funds allowed, the basement was extended, and the current brick church completed in. In, the church, its rectory, and the rectory s garage were listed in the National Register of Historic Places, as the work of noted Nebraska architect Jacob M. Nachtigall. A pupil of Thomas Rogers Kimball, Nachtigall designed a number of Catholic churches and other buildings in the state, several of which are also listed in the National Register. In, the Franciscans turned the management of the parish over to the Diocese of Omaha. In October of that year, Edward S. Muenich became the first diocesan pastor of St. Leonard s.

In, a Romanesque Revival church designed by Nachtigall was built on the existing basement. The cornerstone was laid and construction begun in May the church was completed by the end of November, and formally dedicated on December. The cost of construction was about,. While the church was under construction, Catholic services were held in Madison s armory. The cornerstone for a new school was laid in November. A property adjoining the new school site was bought, and the house standing upon it converted to a convent for the nuns staffing the school. The new building was completed and opened for classes in August the old school, which had begun life as the first St. Leonard s Church, was demolished that fall, and its site became a parking lot. The Benedictine Sisters withdrew from the school in, prompting the closing of the seventh and eighth grades. The school continued to offer grades, taught by three lay instructors. The church is oriented east west, with the main entrance facing westward. It is just over feet m long from east to west feet m wide from north to south. The walls are made of mosaic gray pressed brick trimmed with Bedford stone, rising from a rock faced limestone foundation, and are about feet m high. The peak of the roof is about feet m above ground level. At the northwest and southwest corners of the chancel are two side altars to the north, a Marian altar to the south, an altar of St. Joseph.

Vasco da Gama was a central battery ironclad which entered service with the Portuguese Navy in, serving until. She was built by the Thames Iron Works in London, launched in, and completed in. She served as the flagship of the Portuguese fleet for the majority of her long and peaceful career. She was rebuilt and heavily modernized between and. Long since obsolete by the s, Vasco da Gama was finally sold for scrapping in. As built, Vasco da Gama was armed with a main battery of two. in mm guns, placed in individual barbettes side by side amidships. She was also equipped with a single. in mm gun mounted on her stern, and four pounder guns for close range defense against torpedo boats. She was protected with a complete iron armored belt that was inches mm thick on either end and in mm thick amidships. The main battery guns were protected by inch mm thick barbettes. In March, James confirmed that she had left Home and Away. She has already filmed her final scenes and Nicole will leave on screen later in the year. Of her departure, James said I was at Home and Away for three and a half years, so it s good to be finished and get to be who I am, and do what I ve wanted to do for so long. In, James told Inside Soap that Nicole and Geoff had a strong friendship underneath their romance. She also described their compatibility stating They re complete opposites, which works well for them. It s a bit of a fiery relationship, and they ve been through a lot together. Whilst Lewis added They re also very similar in some of their strongest traits. Geoff and Nicole are both stubborn and opinionated, and in some ways they re naive. In a weird way they show a side to each other nobody else gets to see. James opined Nicole s wild behaviour was often to much for Geoff to cope with. In public, Lewis initially had negative feedback from older viewers because they felt Geoff was better suited to Melody. He revealed they felt like she was a bad influence for Geoff because she often played games. However towards the end of their relationship he felt perception had changed due to viewers having a better understanding of Nicole s persona. Later that year the serial included a storyline which was branded bizarre after it mirrored a real life scandal that had occurred weeks earlier. Lewis who plays love interest Geoff had been caught up in a sex tape scandal which leaked onto the internet, the serial decided to include Nicole making a sex tape with Trey Palmer Luke Bracey and having it leaked. Trey filmed without Nicole s consent, when she found out the truth she ended their relationship. Trey thought she and Geoff were getting back together so aired the tape at a local film festival to gain revenge. James described Nicole s state of mind adding, She s quite vulnerable at the moment, with her dad, Roman, in prison. She s relying on Trey, so this is the last thing she needs. Nicole became more irresponsible with the more she drank and was in the company of many men. Geoff arrived and saved her from danger, Lewis said there was a part of Geoff that still loved Nicole. However they did not start anything again, James said she understood why because of their complicated backstory. However Geoff continued to support Nicole as he realised that a lot of people she was closest to have deserted her. Nicole s unpredictable behaviour continued thereafter. All that Geoff could offer was to be there for her because ultimately Nicole is the only one that can save her from herself.

Tonin was an aggressive state in the Late Classic, using warfare to develop a powerful kingdom. For much of its history, Tonin was engaged in sporadic warfare with Palenque, its greatest rival and one of the most important polities in the west of the Maya region, although Tonin eventually became the dominant city in the west. The city is notable for having the last known Long Count date on any Maya monument, marking the end of the Classic Maya period in AD. Rulers of Tonin recorded in the Maya script on Tonin monuments include The last known recorded date at the site is featured on Monument as January CE. Tonin had a particularly active Early Classic presence, although the Early Classic remains lie entirely buried under later construction. Due to this, early texts are scarce and only offer a glimpse of the early history of the site. An th century text refers to a king ruling in AD, although it only mentions his title, not his name. The site is accessible for tourism and has a small museum that was inaugurated on July. Much of the public imagery of the site details the ruthless manner in which the city dealt with its enemies. A by metres by ft stucco sculpture rising from the fourth to fifth terraces depicts a skeletal death god carrying the severed head of a lord of Palenque in one hand. A frieze on the fifth terrace probably displayed Tonin s most distinguished victims, dozens of fragments of this frieze were discovered in the plaza below. This frieze was carved from the local sandstone but its style is that of Palenque, suggesting that captured artists carried out the work. After the abandonment of the city at the end of the Classic Period, many of the sculptures fell down the steep embankment supporting the seven terraces. The monuments of Tonin tend to be smaller than those at other Maya sites, with most of the stelae measuring less than metres. ft tall. The most important difference from monuments at other Maya sites is that they are carved in the round like statues, often with hieroglyphic text running down the spine. On the fifth terrace, in the round sculptures of Tonin s rulers dominated two dimensional representations of defeated enemies. The dated monuments at Tonin span the period from AD to, covering most of the Classic Period. Monument was recovered from a school in Ocosingo and moved to the site museum of Tonin. It is a badly eroded life size human statue with the head missing. Monument dates to the reign of Ruler. It marks the period ending of and shows the presentation of three war captives. Monument is an undated fragment that depicts a female captive, which is rare in Maya art. Monument is the earliest securely dated monument at the site, dating to AD. It depicts Ruler. Monument depicts Ruler participating in a scattering ritual. Although numbers have declined steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List because of its huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names. Nest success in undisturbed sites is high, at, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method and timing of mowing is crucial mechanized mowing can kill of chicks in a given site, and losses average of first brood chicks and somewhat less than of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother to a greater or lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under, although some individuals may live for years. Until, despite a breeding range estimated at, km, sq mi, the corn crake was classified as near threatened on the IUCN Red List because of serious declines in Europe, but improved monitoring in Russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased. It is therefore now classed as least concern, since the major populations in Russia and Kazakhstan are not expected to change much in the short term. There are an estimated.. million breeding pairs in Europe, three quarters of which are in European Russia, and a further,, pairs in Asiatic Russia the total Eurasian population has been estimated at between. and. million individuals. In much of the western half of its range, there have been long term declines that are expected to continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including a five fold increase in Finland, and a doubling in the UK. In the Netherlands, there were breeding territories in, but this number had increased to at least by. Most rails are secretive wetland birds that have made little cultural impression, but as a formerly common farmland bird with a loud nocturnal call that sometimes led to disturbed sleep for rural dwellers, the corn crake has acquired a variety of folk names and some commemoration in literature. The symptoms of AML are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated. AML has several subtypes treatment and prognosis vary among subtypes. AML is cured in of people less than years old and more than years old. Older people who are not able to withstand intensive chemotherapy have an average survival of months. A number of risk factors for developing AML have been identified, including other blood disorders, chemical exposures, ionizing radiation, and genetics. The WHO subtypes of AML are Eight FAB subtypes were proposed in. The single most important prognostic factor in AML is cytogenetics, or the chromosomal structure of the leukemic cell. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes for example, the translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia. About half of people with AML have normal cytogenetics they fall into an intermediate risk group. A number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and a high risk of relapse after treatment. Acute myeloid leukemia is a relatively rare cancer. There are approximately, new cases each year in the United States, and the incidence rate has remained stable from through. AML accounts for. of all cancer deaths in the United States. The incidence of AML increases with age the median age at diagnosis is years. AML accounts for about of all acute leukemias in adults, but is rare in children. The rate of therapy related AML that is, AML caused by previous chemotherapy is rising therapy related disease currently accounts for about of all cases of AML. AML is slightly more common in men, with a male to female ratio of.. There is some geographic variation in the incidence of AML. In adults, the highest rates are seen in North America, Europe, and Oceania, while adult AML is rarer in Asia and Latin America. In contrast, childhood AML is less common in North America and India than in other parts of Asia. These differences may be due to population genetics, environmental factors, or a combination of the two. AML accounts for of all leukaemia cases in the UK, and around, people were diagnosed with the disease in. In, AML became the first cancer genome to be fully sequenced. DNA extracted from leukemic cells were compared to unaffected skin. The leukemic cells contained acquired mutations in several genes that had not previously been associated with the disease.

A violent dispute erupted between migrant Uyghurs and Han workers at a toy factory in Shaoguan as a result of allegations of the sexual assault of a Han female. Groups of Han set upon Uyghur co workers, leading to at least two Uyghurs being killed, Uyghur workers who witnessed the incident report at least dead and wounded and some people injured. The event was widely cited as the trigger event for July rmqi riots, which ostensibly started as a peaceful street protest demanding official action over the two Uyghurs who died in Shaoguan. Following trials in October, one person was executed and several others sentenced to terms between life imprisonment and five to seven years. During the th century, Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center and one of the largest ports in the United States. It was devastated by the Galveston Hurricane, whose effects included flooding and a storm surge. The natural disaster on the exposed barrier island is still ranked as the deadliest in United States history, with an estimated toll of, people. Much of Galveston s modern economy is centered in the tourism, health care, shipping, and financial industries. The acre, m University of Texas Medical Branch campus with an enrollment of more than, students is a major economic force of the city. Galveston is home to six historic districts containing one of the largest and historically significant collections of th century buildings in the United States, with over structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In the City of Galveston adopted a charter and was incorporated by the Congress of the Republic of Texas. The city was by then a burgeoning port of entry and attracted many new residents in the s and later among the flood of German immigrants to Texas, including Jewish merchants. Together with ethnic Mexican residents, these groups tended to oppose slavery, support the Union during the Civil War, and join the Republican Party after the war. On September, the island was struck by a devastating hurricane. This event holds the record as the United States deadliest natural disaster. The city was devastated, and an estimated, to, people on the island were killed. Following the storm, a mile km long, foot. m high seawall was constructed to protect the city from floods and hurricane storm surge. A team of engineers including Henry Martyn Robert Robert s Rules of Order designed the plan to raise much of the existing city to a sufficient elevation behind a seawall so that confidence in the city could be maintained. The city developed the city commission form of city government, known as the Galveston Plan, to help expedite recovery. The end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas, Nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island. Finally in, Texas Attorney General Will Wilson and the Texas Rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city. As these vice industries crashed, so did tourism, taking the rest of the Galveston economy with it. Neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward. With the s came the expansion of higher education in Galveston. Already home to the University of Texas Medical Branch, the city got a boost in with the creation of the Texas Maritime Academy, predecessor of Texas A M University at Galveston and by a community college, Galveston College, had been established. In the s, property values rose after expensive projects were completed and demand for second homes by the wealthy increased. It has made it difficult for middle class workers to find affordable housing on the island. Hurricane Ike made landfall on Galveston Island in the early morning of September, as a Category hurricane with winds of miles per hour. Damage was extensive to buildings along the seawall. After the storm, the island was rebuilt with further investments into tourism, shipping, and continued emphasis on higher education and health care. Notably the addition of the Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier and the replacement of the bascule type drawbridge on the railroad causeway with a vertical lift type drawbridge to allow heavier freight. The city of Galveston is situated on Galveston Island, a barrier island off the Texas Gulf coast near the mainland coast. Made up of mostly sand sized particles and smaller amounts of finer mud sediments and larger gravel sized sediments, the island is unstable, affected by water and weather, and can shift its boundaries through erosion. The city is about miles km southeast of downtown Houston. The island is oriented generally northeast southwest, with the Gulf of Mexico on the east and south, West Bay on the west, and Galveston Bay on the north. The island s main access point from the mainland is the Interstate Highway causeway that crosses West Bay on the northeast side of the island. A deepwater channel connects Galveston s harbor with the Gulf and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of. square miles km, of which. square miles km is land and. square miles km and. is water. The island is miles km southeast of Houston. The city is also home to a bed acute burns hospital for children, the Shriners Burns Hospital at Galveston. The Galveston hospital is one of only four in the chain of non profit Shriners hospitals, that provides acute burns care. Although the Galveston Hospital was damaged by Hurricane Ike, the Shriners national convention held in July voted to repair and reopen the hospital. Galveston Arts Center In October, Galveston Arts Center will celebrate relocation to its original home, the historic First National Bank Building on the Strand. This Italianate style Storm survivor was extensively damaged during Hurricane Ike in. Fortunately, just weeks before Ike made landfall, scaffolding was installed to support the entire structural load of the building for repairs, likely preventing collapse under heavy winds and storm surge. After a lengthy fundraising campaign, restoration is nearing completion.

The Galveston Police Department has provided the city s police protection for more than years. Over authorized officers serve in three divisions. Galveston is home to two post secondary institutions offering traditional degrees in higher education. Galveston College, a junior college that opened in, and Texas A M University at Galveston, an ocean oriented branch campus of Texas A M University. The city of Galveston is served by Galveston Independent School District, which includes six elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school, Ball High School. There is also one magnet middle school, Austin Middle School, serving grades through. Galveston is the name of a popular song written by Jimmy Webb and sung by Glen Campbell. Sheldon Cooper, one of the main characters from the TV series The Big Bang Theory, grew up in Galveston. The theater film, The Man from Galveston, was the original pilot episode of the proposed NBC western television series Temple Houston, with Jeffrey Hunter cast as Temple Lea Houston, a lawyer and the youngest son of the legendary Sam Houston. For a time the real Temple Houston was the county attorney of Brazoria County, Texas. The Temple Houston series lasted for only twenty six episodes in the television season. Galveston has five sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International Veracruz, Mexico Stavanger, Norway While there had been a petroleum industry in the Sarnia area since, the establishment of Polymer Corporation in to manufacture synthetic rubber during World War II was a great success and began Sarnia s rise as a major petrochemical centre. Because of Sarnia s importance in this industry, it appeared on a United States Government list of possible Soviet targets as part of its Anti Energy nuclear strike strategy during the Cold War. On January, Sarnia and the neighbouring town of Clearwater were amalgamated as the new city of Sarnia Clearwater. The amalgamation was originally slated to include the village of Point Edward, although that village s residents resisted and were eventually permitted to remain independent of the city. On January, the city reverted to the name Sarnia. In the Census, the City of Sarnia had a population of, an increase of. from the Census. With a land area of. km. sq mi, it had a population density of. km,. sq mi in. Besides the single museum in Sarnia proper, six other museums in the local area document Sarnia s history, including its legacy as the home of the North American Oil Industry. Gallery Lambton offers annual art exhibitions. In the Judith and Norman Alex Art Gallery opened. It is an international Category A art gallery. Sarnia City Council consists of nine elected members the Mayor, four members from the city, and four members from the county. The Mayor and all Council members are elected to four year terms. The four Lambton County Council members serve both County and City Council. The St. Clair Catholic District School Board is responsible for the city s seven elementary and two secondary Catholic schools St. Christopher s and St. Patrick s.

In, after a highly publicized feud between Finkelstein and an academic opponent, Alan Dershowitz, Finkelstein s tenure bid at DePaul was denied. Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the academic year, and on September, he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms. An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence played no role in the decision. In, he was banned from entering Israel for years. Citing linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky as an example, Finkelstein notes that it is possible to unite exacting scholarly rigor with scathing moral outrage, and supporters and detractors alike have remarked on the polemical style of Finkelstein s work. Its content has been praised by eminent historians such as Raul Hilberg and Avi Shlaim, as well as Chomsky. Millions of people the world over, smothered by false history and propaganda, will be grateful for this clear account of the origins of the Palestinians. Finkelstein published portions of his thesis in the following publications A Land Without a People Joan Peters Wilderness Image, Chapter of Image and Reality of the Israel Palestine Conflict. Dershowitz threatened libel action over the charges in Finkelstein s book, as a consequence of which, the publisher deleted the word plagiarism from the text before publication. Finkelstein agreed to remove the suggestion that Dershowitz was not the true author of The Case for Israel because, as the publisher said, he couldn t document that. In their joint interview on Democracy Now, however, Finkelstein cited specific passages in Dershowitz s book in which a phrase that he says Peters coined was incorrectly attributed to George Orwell Responding to an article in The Nation by Alexander Cockburn, Dershowitz also cited The Chicago Manual of Style Cockburn s claim is that some of the quotes should not have been cited to their original sources but rather to a secondary source, where he believes I stumbled upon them. Even if he were correct that I found all these quotations in Peters s book, the preferred method of citation is to the original source, as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes With all reuse of others materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This... helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism... To cite a source from a secondary source quoted in... is generally to be discouraged....... to which Cockburn responded In an April, interview with the Harvard Crimson, Dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter last September to DePaul faculty members lobbying against Finkelstein s tenure. When asked how he, as the son of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel s operation in Gaza, Finkelstein replied Finkelstein is an advocate of a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Finkelstein argued one of Israel s primary motivations for launching the offensive in Gaza was that Hamas was signaling that it wanted a diplomatic settlement of the conflict along the June border. Finkelstein believes Hamas had joined the international community in seeking a diplomatic settlement and describes Hamas s stance towards Israel prior to the war as a peace offensive.

Cambridge won by twenty lengths in a record equalling time of minutes seconds, taking the overall record in the event to in Oxford s favour. The Ten Commandments are recognized as a moral foundation by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. They first appear in the Book of Exodus, according to which Moses, acting under the orders of God, freed the Israelites from physical slavery in Egypt. According to Church teaching, God offered a covenant which included the Ten Commandments to also free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. Some historians have described this as the central event in the history of ancient Israel. According to Catholic teaching, this commandment does not preclude the use of God s name in taking solemn oaths administered by legitimate authority. However, lying under oath, invoking God s name for magical purposes, or voicing words of hatred or defiance against God are considered sins of blasphemy. The Catechism says this commandment requires duties of children to parents that include Respect toward parents that also flows to brothers and sisters. Support that requires grown children to offer material and moral support for their aging parents, particularly at times of illness, loneliness, or distress. Keeping this commandment, according to the Catechism, also requires duties of parents to children which include Respect for their children as children of God and human persons. Being a good example to their children. To practice charity, which is a necessity for any working family or society it is the greatest social commandment and requires people to love God and neighbor. To welcome the foreigner who is in need of security and livelihood that cannot be found in his own country. An obligation for rich nations to help poor nations, especially in times of immediate need. An expectation for families to help other families. The Church requires all to pray and work to prevent unjust wars, but allows for just wars if certain conditions are met The reasons for going to war are defensive. The damage inflicted by the aggressor... must be lasting, grave, and certain. It is a last resort taken only after all other means of putting an end to the grave damage have been ineffective. The ultimate aim is peace and there is a serious chance of success. The Catechism lists the following offenses against chastity in increasing order of gravity Lust the Church teaches that sexual pleasure is good and created by God, who meant for spouses to experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit. Kreeft says, Lust does not mean sexual pleasure as such, nor the delight in it, nor the desire for it in its right context. Lust is the desire for sexual pleasure alone, outside its intended purpose of procreation and the uniting of man and woman, body and soul, in mutual self donation. According to the Church, adultery and divorce are considered offenses against the dignity of marriage and are defined as follows In extreme situations, such as domestic violence, separation is allowed. This is not considered a divorce and may be justified. Civil divorce is not a divorce according to the Church. If it is deemed to be the only way of ensuring legal rights, care of children, or protection of inheritance, the Church considers it morally acceptable. According to the Church, people have a right to private property. However, ownership makes that person a steward who is expected to make it fruitful or profitable in a way that benefits others after that person has first taken care of their family. Private property and the common good are seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society. The taking of another s private property in obvious and urgent necessity as the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs food, shelter, clothing is not considered by the Church to be stealing. The concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the Church, which classifies it as the stealing of a person s human rights. Following acts are also considered as violation of the seventh commandment price manipulation to get advantage on the harm of others, corruption, appropriation of the public goods for personal interests, work poorly carried out, tax avoidance, counterfeiting of checks or any means of payment, any forms of copyright infringement and piracy, and extravagance. Purity of heart is suggested as the necessary quality needed to accomplish this task common Catholic prayers and hymns include a request for this virtue. The Church identifies gifts of God that help a person maintain purity Purity of intention, which seeks to fulfill God s will in everything, knowing that it alone will lead to the true end of man. Prayer that recognizes the power of God to grant a person the ability to overcome sexual desires. Technically, it is known as a speaker that easily reveals poor quality in recordings. Recording engineers sought to dull its treble response by hanging tissue paper in front of it, resulting in what became known as the tissue paper effect, a type of comb filtering. The NS has been used to monitor a large number of successful recordings by numerous artists, leading Gizmodo to refer to it as the most important loudspeaker you never heard of. Yamaha discontinued the product in. Recording studios around the world, particularly those specialising in rock and pop music, adopted the speaker as the standard. In excess of, pairs were sold throughout the world. Gizmodo referred to it as the most important loudspeaker you never heard of. The network is second order passive, crossing over at kHz. The frequency range is quoted from Hz to kHz, and rated power handling is W. The early version of the speaker has press down type output terminals later models had screw terminals. In simplistic terms, the NS possesses sonic characteristics that allow record producers to assume that if a recording sounds good on these monitors, then it should sound good on most playback systems. Whilst it can reveal any shortcomings in the recording mix as well as the monitoring chain, it may lead to listener fatigue with prolonged use in the domestic setting. A report by Newell et al. at Southampton University undertaken for Studio Sound in found that the NS had excellent time domain response at low frequencies its ability to start and stop in response to signal input was found to be superior to that of most other nearfield monitors. Part of this was related to its closed box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments guitar and drums are correctly balanced in the mix. There were many other versions of the NS, the best known of which were the NS M Studio and the NS M Pro, both introduced in. Technically identical to the Studio, the Pro comes fitted with a speaker grille and is meant to be used in a vertical orientation. State Route SR is a nearly. mile long. km state highway in the U.S. state of Utah, connecting SR in Cornish, Cache County to U.S. Route US near Richmond via Lewiston, in the extreme northern part of the state. The highway has existed since at least, as SR since at least, and between and, vehicles travel along the highway on an average day in. The highway s name changes from South to Center Street through Lewiston. Passing the Lewiston Cemetery, SR crosses over the Cub River and a second single track belonging to UP, and then a third UP single track just before the highway s eastern terminus at US north of Richmond. All of the rail lines that SR crosses originally belonged to the Oregon Short Line Railway. Aside from the segment through Lewiston, the highway is surrounded by farmland for its entire journey across northern Utah. The entire route is in Cache County. Between and, Sweden built six hemmemas. The hemmema became the largest and most heavily armed vessel in the archipelago fleet and served in the Russo Swedish War of. Oden, the first hemmema, was relatively small and very similar to a turuma, a different type of archipelago frigate. Russia built six hemmemas based on the Swedish design between and after capturing three of the Swedish vessels at the surrender of Sveaborg in. The later versions, both Swedish and Russian, were much larger and much more heavily armed than Oden. Under the Finnish form Hmeenmaa, the name of the ship type was later carried on to several vessels of the th century Finnish Navy. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin Madison, Creutz helped Princeton University build its first cyclotron. During World War II he worked on nuclear reactor design under Eugene Wigner at the Metallurgical Laboratory, designing the cooling system for the first water cooled reactors. He led a group that studied the metallurgy of uranium and other elements used in reactor designs. In October, he moved to the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he became a group leader. After the war ended, Creutz accepted an offer to come to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he became the head of its Physics Department and its Nuclear Research Center in. In he returned to Los Alamos to evaluate its thermonuclear fusion program for the Atomic Energy Commission. While there he accepted an offer to become Vice President for Research and Development and the Director of its John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science at General Atomics. Under his leadership, General Atomics developed TRIGA, a nuclear reactor for universities and laboratories. Wigner moved to Princeton University in, and soon after Creutz received an offer as well. Princeton had been given a inch mm magnet by the University of California, which had been used to build an MeV cyclotron. They wanted Creutz to help get it operational. He later recalled Del Toso made her debut with the Australia women s national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, at the Osaka Cup in Japan. Since winning a silver medal in London, she has participated in the Osaka Cup in Japan, where the Gliders successfully defended the title they had won in, and. In, Del Toso was named as a reserve for the Australia women s national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, for the Summer Paralympics. She made her national team debut at the Osaka Cup the following year, when her team finished first. That year, she also participated in the Four Nations in Canada and the Japan Friendly Series, one of six players who played for the Dandenong Rangers in the WNWBL. She was selected to participate in a national team training camp in. In July, she played in a three game test series against Germany. She was member of the Australian team at the World Championships that finished fourth. She also played in the Osaka Cup where her team finished first. She played in four games in the Gliders World Challenge. Del Toso was selected to represent Australia at the Summer Paralympics in wheelchair basketball. The London Games were her first. In the group stage, the Australia women s national wheelchair basketball team at the Summer Paralympics posted wins against Brazil, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, but lost to Canada. This was enough to advance the Gliders to the quarter finals, where they beat Mexico. The Gliders then defeated the United States by a point to set up a final clash with Germany. The Gliders lost, and earned a silver medal. Since the games, Del Toso has participated in the Osaka Cup in Japan, where the Gliders successfully defended the title they had won in, and. In May, Nos., and Squadrons attacked Japanese positions in Timor, while No. Squadron was withdrawn from combat to re equip with Mitchells. No. Wing s light and medium bombers suffered from a lack of suitable targets as they had few airfields in forward areas from which to refuel. No. Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June. That month, No. Squadron flew sorties, damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area, but lost its commanding officer to anti aircraft fire during a raid. The episode was watched by. million U.S. viewers and attained a. rating share in the demographic. Glee maintained its ratings from the previous week, despite all of the other new Wednesday night shows of the season declining by double digit percentages. It was the eighteenth most watched show in Canada for the week of broadcast, with. million viewers. In the UK, the episode was watched by. million viewers. million on E, and, on E, becoming the most watched show on E and E for the week, and the most watched show on cable for the week, as well as the most watched episode of the series at the time. Fern Hobbs May, April, was an American attorney in the U.S. state of Oregon, and a private secretary to Oregon Governor Oswald West. She was noted for her ambition and several accomplishments as a young woman, and became the highest paid woman in public service in America in her mid twenties. Hobbs later worked for the American Red Cross in Europe and at the Oregon Journal newspaper. She died in Portland in. The actions of the governor were later challenged in court, with Hobbs and West among the defendants. The saloon keepers sought remuneration for liquor they claimed was confiscated during the period of martial law. The Baker County circuit court determined the governor s actions were within his powers, and the Oregon Supreme Court ultimately concurred. These events made Hobbs the most famous woman in Oregon at that time. Hobbs also made national and international news for these events. Writer Stewart Holbrook reported Upon returning to Oregon, Hobbs worked as a secretary for the Oregon Journal newspaper. She retired in as the secretary to the paper s business manager. Fern Hobbs died on April, at the age of, and was buried at the Hillsboro Pioneer Cemetery in Hillsboro, Oregon. Stephen later become more involved in formal political parties, being elected as a local councillor and standing as a candidate in general elections. After moving to Bristol she became the first woman president of Bristol Trades Council. She was appointed MBE in and her life is commemorated by a blue plaque in Bristol. Stephen is recorded in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as a suffragette and labour activist, and has been described as working class. Her father s low and variable income meant that she could not afford to pursue her aspiration to become a teacher, and became a domestic worker at the age of. Her father was a founder member of the Independent Labour Party ILP when it was established in. She described her mother as being so quiet and the very opposite of dad. Of Human Feelings is a studio album by American jazz saxophonist and composer Ornette Coleman. It was recorded on April, at CBS Studios in New York City with his band Prime Time, which featured guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Calvin Weston and Coleman s son Denardo.

But instead of teaching them his own technique, it states Yue taught what he had learned from Zhou to his soldiers who were victorious in battle. Yue lives in a shed by his grave through the winter and in the second lunar month of the following year, his martial brothers come and pull the building down, forcing him to return home and take care of his mother. The quoted death date is not only unreliable because the book is fiction, but also because the Xuan He reign era of Emperor Huizong lasted only seven years and not seventeen. Although The Story of Yue Fei states Zhou died shortly before Yue took a wife, he historically died after Yue married. It is likely that the original author invented this fictional date. The Water Margin c. is a Ming Dynasty military romance about one hundred and eight demons born men and women who band together to rebel against the lavish Song Dynasty government. Lin Chong and Lu Junyi, two of these outlaws, are briefly mentioned as being Zhou s previous students in The Story of Yue Fei. They are not characters within the main plot, though, as both are killed by villainous officials prior to Zhou becoming precept of the Wang household. Most importantly, the two were not among his historical students since they are fictional characters. The Land Forces must, independently or together with other Romanian military branches, conduct operations and defensive or offensive battles, for capture, or destruction of the invading enemy, being part of national, or multinational military structures. A part of the units which compose the current operational structure of the Land Forces, must be able to conduct military operations outside the national territory, together with the international military forces. After World War I, Transylvania proclaimed union with the Kingdom of Romania. As a result, in April, the newly established Hungarian Soviet Republic vowed to retake the region by force, and Hungarian troops attacked Romanian formations in Transylvania. The Romanian Army defeated the Hungarians and conquered Budapest in August. The greatest disaster for the Romanian expeditionary force on the Eastern Front came at Stalingrad, where, during the Soviet counter offensive of November, the thinly spread forces of the Third Army deployed north of Stalingrad and of the Fourth Army deployed south of Stalingrad were attacked by vastly superior Soviet forces and suffered combined losses of some, personnel. Equipment Summary The following troops are deployed abroad Hartley spent several years writing a detailed research document, which served to some degree as a script for the film, about the New Wave era of Australian cinema. It focused on the commonly overlooked Ozploitation films mainly filled with sex, horror and violence which critics and film historians considered vulgar and offensive, often excluded from Australia s official film history. Hartley approached Quentin Tarantino, a longtime Ozploitation fan who had dedicated his film Kill Bill to the exploitation genre, and Tarantino agreed to help get the project off the ground. Hartley then spent an additional five years interviewing subjects and editing the combined hours of interviews and original stock footage into a minute film. Not Quite Hollywood, which premiered at the Melbourne International Film Festival, did not perform well at the box office upon its Australia wide release, but garnered universally positive reviews from critics and a nomination for Best Documentary at the Australian Film Institute Awards. The actors, directors, screenwriters and producers interviewed for the film were English director Edgar Wright named Not Quite Hollywood his fourth favourite film of, and called it the best documentary ever. A list of film referenced within Not Quite Hollywood, separated by genre. Not Quite Hollywood The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation, grossed, at the box office in Australia,. The song garnered positive reviews from critics, who commended Houston s vocal effort. It charted in the United States on the Billboard Hot, peaking at number twenty six. It also reached a peak position of number twenty two in the Hot R B Hip Hop Songs chart and number six on the Adult Contemporary chart. In Canada, the song reached a peak of number forty five on the RPM Singles chart. Although there is no official music video for the song, a performance of the song at the MTV Movie Awards was taped and is used as a promotional clip. The song was later included as a medley, in her My Love Is Your Love World Tour, along with a few other songs. Released as the seventh and final single from the Waiting to Exhale Original Soundtrack Album, the song debuted at number on the Billboard Hot, on the issue dated August,. On the same issue, the song debuted at number on the Hot R B Hip Hop Singles chart. The song later reached a peak of number on the Hot, and on the R B Hip Hop Singles chart. It also reached number six on the Adult Contemporary chart, while reaching a peak of on the Adult Pop Songs chart. In Canada, the song debuted at number on the RPM Singles chart, on the July, issue. Later, on the September, issue, it reached a peak of number. Retrieved from CD liner notes Throughout the eastern Caribbean, Omar affected numerous islands, most of which only recorded minor impacts. Large swells and heavy rains impacted the ABC islands. Antigua and Barbuda sustained million in damages, mainly on Antigua as nine homes were destroyed, several others damaged and many farms were inundated by flood waters. One person died in Puerto Rico after suffering a stress induced cardiac arrest. The United States Virgin Islands also sustained significant damage, costing roughly million. Numerous boats and homes were damaged and over power poles were snapped. Total losses from the storm were estimated at million. On September, a well developed tropical wave moved off the eastern coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean. Deep convection formed around a prominent mid level circulation as it moved towards the west. However, the convection diminished on October before entering the Caribbean Sea a week later. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low. Continued development followed and the low was designated as Tropical Depression Fifteen at UTC on October while located about miles kilometres south of the southeastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The previous steady westward motion that the system took across the Atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two. As the structure of the storm improved, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the National Hurricane Center NHC gave it the name Omar. Located to the southeast of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to the west of a low to mid level ridge, Omar took a counter clockwise turn on October. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, an. to. mi. to. km wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of mph km h, signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well developed outflow and prominent banding features. With very warm sea surface temperatures, high ocean heat content, low wind shear, and a moist air mass, Omar quickly reached its peak intensity early on October as a Category hurricane with winds of mph km h. During the intensification phase, the forward motion of the hurricane increased to mph km h. Once in the Atlantic Ocean, Omar began to rapidly weaken, with winds decreasing by mph km h in hours. Visible satellite images depicted an exposed low level circulation with convection displaced to the east due to a combination of very high wind shear and dry air. By October, most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated however, a brief decrease in wind shear allowed Omar to re strengthen to its secondary peak, with winds of mph km h. During this phase, convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed. Later that day, the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed Omar, leading to decreasing movement. A weakening storm, Omar continued towards the northeast due to a mid to upper level ridge located south of the system and the mid latitude westerlies to the north. Late on October, wind shear increased once more as Omar tracked over waters below C F. Around UTC on October, Omar weakened to a tropical storm as deep convection associated with it dissipated. Twelve hours later, while still producing tropical storm force winds, the storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The remnants of Omar persisted until UTC on October when it dissipated about mi, km west of the Azores. Omar produced moderate damage throughout numerous islands, amounting to at least million USD and one death was related to the storm. In Puerto Rico, a man died after he collapsed from cardiac arrest while trying to install storm shutters on his home. As a tropical wave, the precedent to Omar produced heavy rains over the island, causing minor flooding. After passing by Puerto Rico a second time, Omar produced locally heavy rains, which caused minor street flooding. On St. Croix, waves up to ft. m from Omar sank about boats, leading to a large oil spill around the islands. About ships broke lose from the docks, of which lost their anchors. Omar produced upwards of in. mm of rain on the island within a hour span. Although St. Croix was brushed by the eyewall, sustained winds reached mph km h with gusts to mph km h. Three people needed to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink. Most of the islands, residents were without power as over utility poles were destroyed. Damages on the island were estimated at, with another million in clean up costs. St. Thomas, one of the hardest hit islands, was left completely without power in the wake of the hurricane. All of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were either on the ground or without power. Damages on the island totaled to. million. On Dominica, Omar s close pass to the island left families homeless and severely hampered the fishing community. On December, the Board of Directors of the Caribbean Development Bank approved. million for assistance to those affected by Omar on the island and to restore the infrastructure damaged by the hurricane. On December, the government of Dominica invested million in aid for the fishing communities impacted by Omar. A total of fishermen were provided with per week for a total of four weeks. Sixty two of which continued to receive funds due to their circumstances. The government also purchased boat engines to distribute to fishers. Another, was spent to repair boats and construct another that had been damaged or destroyed by Omar. The government also bought replacement fishing gear. Forty six out of fifty seven cardinals participated in the conclave The Spanish and Neapolitan governments had classified forty three Italian cardinals into five categories good eleven cardinals, indifferent eight, doubtful three, bad fifteen and very bad six Cardinal Orsini, the official representative of the Neapolitan court, and all the foreigners, were not classified because it was certain that none of them would be ever elected pope.

The land for the ground was first leased by Yeovil Cricket Club in, and was also used for a range of other sports, most significantly hosting Yeovil Rugby Club in the s, and then again from until the ground was closed. Significant improvements were made to the ground during the s, including the opening of a new pavilion, jointly funded by the Rugby and Cricket clubs. The ground was demolished in when Westland Aircraft extended their factory, and both Yeovil Cricket Club and Rugby Club moved to Johnson Park. Between and, the ground hosted five annual Somerset County Cricket Club matches in July or August the first of which nearly broke a county record for ticket sales on the gate. Somerset only won one of the five matches, the contest against Worcestershire. Yeovil and County Cricket Club was formed in, and was the first attempt at setting up a county cricket team for Somerset. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the club broke up. In, the club was re formed with the lesser remit, as Yeovil Cricket Club. As part of the club s resuscitation, the committee purchased the use of a field in West Hendford in Yeovil, from a local farmer, Mr Brook. The field, part of Key Farm, was leased for. There is record of a match being played on the ground the following year between two sets of members of the Yeovil Cricket Club. During the late th century, the ground was used for other sports as well as cricket it had a grass athletics track, and also hosted Yeovil Football Club, who at the time played both association and rugby football. The football club played at West Hendford on an irregular basis during the late th century, but returned in, by which time they only played rugby, and had changed their name accordingly to Yeovil Rugby Club. In, the cricket club committee announced that there was provision for a longer lease, of five or seven years, and that they would make improvements to the ground to enable it to host first class cricket. The ground was also used for field hockey in the early th century, hosting a Yeovil Hockey Club. New Year s Eve received mostly positive reviews from critics. According to the Nielsen Media Research, New Year s Eve drew. million viewers and received a. rating share in the demographic, marking a rise in the ratings from the previous episode, First Christmas. It ranked third in its timeslot and was the second highest rated NBC program of the night after The Office. Brooks considers the theme of uncertainty central to the zombie genre. He believes that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxiety about the end of the world. Brooks has expressed a deep fear of zombies Sentence spacing is the horizontal space between sentences in typeset text. It is a matter of typographical convention. Since the introduction of movable type printing in Europe, various sentence spacing conventions have been used in languages with a Latin alphabet. These include a normal word space as between the words in a sentence, a single enlarged space, and two full spaces. Until the th century, publishing houses and printers in many countries used additional space between sentences. There were exceptions to this traditional spacing method some printers used spacing between sentences that was no wider than word spacing. This was French spacing a term synonymous with single space sentence spacing until the late th century. With the introduction of the typewriter in the late th century, typists used two spaces between sentences to mimic the style used by traditional typesetters. While wide sentence spacing was phased out in the printing industry in the mid twentieth century, the practice continued on typewriters and later on computers. Perhaps because of this, many modern sources now incorrectly claim that wide spacing was created for the typewriter. The desired or correct sentence spacing is often debated but many sources now say additional space is not necessary or desirable. From around, single sentence spacing became standard in books, magazines and newspapers and the majority of style guides that use a Latin derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence. However, some sources still state that additional spacing is correct or acceptable. The debate continues on the World Wide Web. Many people prefer double sentence spacing for informal use because that was how they were taught to type. There is a debate on which convention is more readable the few recent direct studies conducted since have produced inconclusive results. Modern style guides provide standards and guidance for the written language. These works are important to writers since virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication. Late editions of comprehensive style guides, such as the Oxford Style Manual in the United Kingdom and the Chicago Manual of Style in the United States, provide standards for a wide variety of writing and design topics, including sentence spacing. The majority of style guides now prescribe the use of a single space after terminal punctuation in final written works and publications. A few style guides allow double sentence spacing for draft work, and the Gregg Reference Manual makes room for double and single sentence spacing based on author preferences. Web design guides do not usually provide guidance on this topic, as HTML refuses to recognize double spaces altogether. These works themselves follow the current publication standard of single sentence spacing. Microsoft Word does not treat sentences differently by default, but the grammar checking can be set to prefer a specific number of spaces between sentences. Most style guides indicate that single sentence spacing is proper for final or published work today, and most publishers require manuscripts to be submitted as they will appear in publication single sentence spaced. Writing sources typically recommend that prospective authors remove extra spaces before submitting manuscripts, although other sources state that publishers will use software to remove the spaces before final publication.

Even if it cannot be proved, this assumption is considered safe by Rowson and logical by Adorjn. Watson agrees that the proper result of a perfectly played chess game... is a draw.... Of course, I can t prove this, but I doubt that you can find a single strong player who would disagree.... I remember Kasparov, after a last round draw, explaining to the waiting reporters Well, chess is a draw. World Champion Bobby Fischer thought that was almost definitely so. Berliner s thesis, like Adams, has been sharply criticized. As explained below, chess theorists in recent decades have continued to debate the size and nature of White s advantage, if any. Apart from Berliner, they have rejected the idea that White has a forced win from the opening position. Many also reject the traditional paradigm that Black s objective should be to neutralize White s initiative and obtain equality. Rowson argues that both White and Black have certain advantages An examination of reversed and symmetrical openings illustrates White s and Black s respective advantages The opening of the following game between two world class players, another Symmetrical English, took a similar course In chess tournaments and matches, the frequency with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent. Jonathan Rowson has speculated that in principle it should be possible for a machine to... develop piece tablebases. This may take decades or even centuries, but unless runaway global warming or nuclear war gets in the way, I think it will eventually happen. However, information theorist Claude Shannon argued that it is not feasible for any computer to actually do this. In his paper Programming a Computer for Playing Chess he writes It is thus theoretically possible to solve chess, determining with certainty whether a perfectly played game should end in a win for White, a draw, or even a win for Black. However, according to Shannon the time frame required puts this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology. A graduate of the Stevens Institute of Technology and New York University, Reines joined the Manhattan Project s Los Alamos Laboratory in, working in the Theoretical Division in Richard Feynman s group. He became a group leader there in. He participated in a number of nuclear tests, culminating in his becoming the director of the Operation Greenhouse test series in the Pacific in. Reines sang in a chorus, and as a soloist. For a time he considered the possibility of a singing career, and was instructed by a vocal coach from the Metropolitan Opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not have the money for them. The family later moved to North Bergen, New Jersey, residing on Kennedy Boulevard and th Street. Because North Bergen did not have a high school, he attended Union Hill High School in Union Hill, New Jersey, from which he graduated in. From an early age, Reines exhibited an interest in science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that e According to Fermi s theory, there was also a corresponding reverse reaction, in which a neutrino combines with a proton to create a neutron and a positron In, Reines took most of his neutrino research team with him when he left for the new University of California, Irvine UCI, becoming its first dean of physical sciences. At UCI, Reines extended the research interests of some of his graduate students into the development of medical radiation detectors, such as for measuring total radiation delivered to the whole human body in radiation therapy. Federal, state, and local governments began construction in of barriers to protect the city. The project included a levee of, feet, m and a flood wall of, feet m along the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek, closure structures, retention basins, a pumping station, and some relocation of roads and buildings. Completed in, the levee protected the city from high water in the year of the Blizzard of, and again, when rainfall from the remnants of Hurricane Ivan threatened the city. Lock Haven is the county seat of Clinton County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of. square miles. km,. square miles. km of which is land. About. square miles. km, percent, is water. In, the city s population included about percent under the age of and about percent who were years of age or older. Females accounted for percent of the total. Students at the university comprised about a third of the city s population. Between and, of the people who were older than, percent had graduated from high school, and percent had at least a bachelor s degree. In, businesses operated in Lock Haven. The mean travel time to work for employees who were at least years old was minutes. The median income for a household in the city during was about, compared to about, for the entire state of Pennsylvania. The per capita income for the city was about, and about percent of Lock Haven s residents lived below the poverty line. By, the lumber industry had declined, and the city s economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, maker of the Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city s biggest employers until the s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment rate of more than in Lock Haven in the early s, though the rate had declined to about by. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the s in Castanea Township, closed in. By, of the city s labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, in manufacturing, in retail trade, in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors. The city s biggest employers, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and Lock Haven Hospital, are among the seven biggest employers in Clinton County. The city has two private schools, Lock Haven Christian School, with about students in kindergarten through th grade, and Lock Haven Catholic School, which had about students in kindergarten through sixth grade as of. In, the Catholic School is completing a, square foot m expansion to include grades seven and eight, which will make it a combined elementary and middle school. Several of the castle s former residents built their houses outside the fortress and a village called al Husn has since developed. Many of the al Husn s roughly, Muslim residents benefit economically from the tourism generated by the site. When the outer walls were built in the th century the main entrance was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for metres ft, and along its length were murder holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle s two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round. The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde s career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde s lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde s homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. His notoriety caused the play, despite its early success, to be closed after performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work. The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere. It has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions. In The Importance of Being Earnest, Dame Edith Evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of Lady Bracknell The Importance of Being Earnest by Kurt Baker used an all black cast and Oliver Parker s The Importance of Being Earnest incorporated some of Wilde s original material cut during the preparation of the original stage production. The cast was John Worthing, J.P. George Alexander Algernon Moncrieff Allan Aynesworth The Marquess of Queensberry, the father of Wilde s lover Lord Alfred Douglas who was on holiday in Algiers at the time, had planned to disrupt the play by throwing a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took his bow at the end of the show. Wilde and Alexander learned of the plan, and the latter cancelled Queensberry s ticket and arranged for policemen to bar his entrance. Nevertheless, he continued harassing Wilde, who eventually launched a private prosecution against the peer for criminal libel, triggering a series of trials ending in Wilde s imprisonment for gross indecency. Alexander tried, unsuccessfully, to save the production by removing Wilde s name from the billing, but the play had to close after only performances. A collected edition of Wilde s works, published in and edited by Robert Ross, helped to restore his reputation as an author. Alexander presented another revival of The Importance at the St James s in, when he and Aynesworth reprised their original roles the revival ran for performances. Max Beerbohm said that the play was sure to become a classic of the English repertory, and that its humour was as fresh then as when it had been written, adding that the actors had worn as well as the play. As Wilde s work came to be read and performed again, it was The Importance of Being Earnest that received the most productions. By the time of its centenary the journalist Mark Lawson described it as the second most known and quoted play in English after Hamlet. In the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, produced the play with an all male cast it also featured Wilde as a character the play opens with him drinking in a Parisian caf, dreaming of his play. The Melbourne Theatre Company staged a production in December with Geoffrey Rush as Lady Bracknell. The play is set in The Present i.e.. Algernon Moncrieff s flat in Half Moon Street, W The play repeatedly mocks Victorian traditions and social customs, marriage and the pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over riding societal value, originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century. The play s very title, with its mocking paradox serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies, introduces the theme, it continues in the drawing room discussion, Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them, says Algernon in Act allusions are quick and from multiple angles. In, Erik Chisholm composed an opera from the play, using Wilde s text as the libretto. It was adapted for Australian TV in. Mathews returned to the African mainland territories once more in when he landed with a force which intended to establish further garrisons there to dissuade German territorial claims. This attempt ultimately failed when five German warships steamed into Zanzibar Town harbour and threatened the Sultan into signing away the territories which would later form German East Africa. Further territories were ceded to the German East Africa Company in but unrest amongst the locals against them prevented them from taking control and Mathews was dispatched with men to restore order. Finding around, people gathered against the German administrators Mathews was forced to return with his men to Zanzibar. He landed once again with more troops but found himself subject to death threats and that his troops would not obey his orders and so returned again to Zanzibar. Boreas displaced, long tons, t at standard load and, long tons, t at deep load. The ship had an overall length of feet. m, a beam of feet inches. m and a draught of feet inches. m. She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of, shaft horsepower, kW and gave a maximum speed of knots km h mph. Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty drum boilers. Boreas carried a maximum of long tons t of fuel oil that gave her a range of, nautical miles, km, mi at knots km h mph. The ship s complement was officers and enlisted men, although it increased to during wartime. The ship was loaned to the Royal Hellenic Navy on February and recommissioned by them on March as Salamis. She was damaged while working up at Scapa Flow and was under repair at Hull from April to June. Salamis was assigned to escort duty at Gibraltar until October when she was transferred to the Aegean where she served with the th Greek Destroyer Flotilla for the rest of the war. The ship was used as a training ship after the war until she was returned to the Royal Navy at Malta on October. Salamis arrived at Rosyth under tow on April to be broken up by Metal Industries, Limited. Throughout the th and th centuries, horses were harvested from the feral herds and used as riding and stock horses, as well as being used for their meat, hair and hides. Originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the British Crown and the native Mori, but many were eradicated with the intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses. Kaimanawa horses today have the highest amount of genetic similarity with the Thoroughbred and other Thoroughbred cross breeds.

The professions of architect, master craftsman, carpenter, and structural engineer did not have the high status of the Confucian scholar officials during the dynastic era. Architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years, usually from craftsman fathers to their sons. There were also government agencies and schools for construction, building, and engineering. The Song dynasty s building manuals aided not only the various private workshops, but also the craftsmen employed by the central government. In the United Kingdom, Lost Horizons peaked at number on the Official Albums Chart, whereas in the United States, it peaked at number on Billboard s Top Electronic Albums component chart. The album s two singles, Space Walk and Nice Weather for Ducks, were also successful, peaking on the UK Singles Chart, at number and respectively.

Unusually this episode begins on the Rock title sequence there is no cold open as is normally the case. Floyd, who broke up with Liz in the episode Hiatus, calls Liz to ask if he can have a place to stay, as he has come to visit New York on business. Liz tries to win Floyd back, only for him to lie to her about going home to Cleveland, Ohio. Floyd eventually travels home, and the pair agree to remain friends.

The. refers to. of all to year olds in the U.S., and the refers to of all to year olds watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S. Since the Spanish Armament of, the Royal Navy had been at sea in a state of readiness for over three years. The Navy s dockyards under First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton were all fully fitted and prepared for conflict. This was quite unlike the disasters of the American Revolutionary War ten years earlier, when an ill prepared Royal Navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the North American campaign which ended in defeat at the Battle of Yorktown due to lack of supplies. With British dockyards now readily turning out cannon, shot, sails, provisions and other essential equipment, the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the Navy list. Taking the bait, the following day Howe attacked again, but his attempt to split the French fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship, HMS Caesar, failed to follow orders. Much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive, and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue. Howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the weather gage, enabling him to further attack Villaret at a time of his choosing. Three French ships were sent back to port with damage, but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained the following day with the arrival of Nielly s detached squadron. Battle was postponed during the next two days because of thick fog, but when the haze lifted on June, the battle lines were only miles km apart and Howe was prepared to force a decisive action. Howe and Queen Charlotte led the fleet by example, sailing directly at the French flagship Montagne. Passing between Montagne and the next in line Vengeur du Peuple, Queen Charlotte raked both and hauled up close to Montagne to engage in a close range artillery battle. As she did so, Queen Charlotte also became briefly entangled with Jacobin, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships. Having escaped to the east, Villaret made what sail his battered fleet could muster to return to France, and dispatched his frigates in search of the convoy. Villaret was also hoping for reinforcements eight ships of the line, commanded by Admiral Pierre Franois Cornic, were patrolling near the Ushant headland. Behind him to the west, the British took the whole night to secure their ships and prizes, not setting out to return to Britain until on June. Casualties in the battle are notoriously hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception Scipion, records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint Andr and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither of which can be treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately, including around, captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies overall British casualties are generally given as around,. Both Britain and France claimed victory in the battle Britain by virtue of capturing or sinking seven French ships without losing any of her own and remaining in control of the battle site France because the vital convoy had passed through the Atlantic unharmed and arrived in France without significant loss. The two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting. The British fleet in Spithead was treated with a Royal visit by King George III and the entire royal household. New York State Route NY was a state highway in Onondaga County, New York, in the United States. It was one of the shortest routes in the county, extending for only. miles. km between NY and NY in the town of Elbridge. NY was known as Halfway Road for the hamlet it served near its midpoint. The route was assigned in the s and removed in as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Onondaga County. The entire route was in Elbridge, Onondaga County. M was a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan entirely in the city of St. Ignace. The highway connected US Highway US to the State Highway Ferry Dock used before the Mackinac Bridge was built. It was retired and the road returned to local control in. M was initially assumed into the state highway system in as a connector between US and Straits State Park. In, US was routed into St. Ignace and US was scaled back to end in the Lower Peninsula in Mackinaw City. M now provided a connection between US and the new docks on the southeast side of the city. It existed in this capacity until when the Mackinac Bridge opened to traffic. The entire highway was in St. Ignace, Mackinac County. The wing dihedral was reduced to from.

From to, nearly, draftees, willing to serve their country in some capacity but unwilling to perform any type of military service, accepted assignments in work of national importance in CPS camps throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Draftees from the historic peace churches and other faiths worked in areas such as soil conservation, forestry, fire fighting, agriculture, under the supervision of such agencies as the U.S. Forest Service, the Soil Conservation Service, and the National Park Service. Others helped provide social services and mental health services. The CPS men served without wages and minimal support from the federal government. The cost of maintaining the CPS camps and providing for the needs of the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families. CPS men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well after the end of the war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men s service and requested more workers from the program. CPS made significant contributions to forest fire prevention, erosion and flood control, medical science and reform of the mental health system. Conscientious objectors COs refuse to participate in military service because of belief or religious training. During wartime, this stance conflicts with conscription efforts. Those willing to accept non combatant roles, such as medical personnel, are accommodated. There are few legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military in any way. As the United States prepared for another war, the historic peace churches, represented by Friends who understood inner dealings of Washington D.C. politics, attempted to influence new draft bills to ensure their men could fulfill their duty in an alternative, non military type of service. On June, the Burke Wadsworth Bill came before Congress. The arrangements for conscientious objectors were almost identical to the World War I provisions. The Friends representatives continued attempting to make the bill more favorable to the historic peace churches. The Burke Wadsworth Bill passed on September, becoming the Selective Training and Service Act of. The influence of the churches was evident in section g, which says in part Any such person claiming such exemption from combatant training and service... in lieu of such induction, be assigned to work of national importance under civilian direction. Sunday worship services were organized by the camp director if he was a pastor, by a visiting pastor, or by the CPS men themselves. While the historic peace churches organized the CPS, of the men came from other denominations and claimed no religious affiliation. Men with wives and dependents found it difficult to support their families. Beyond a small allowance, the men did not get paid for their service, nor were their dependents given an allowance. To be closer to their husbands, women sought employment near their husband s assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, families could live together in housing provided for farm workers. Churches were primarily responsible for financing Civilian Public Service, providing for the men s food, clothes, and other material needs. The churches also provided and paid for the camp director. The men received an allowance of between. and. monthly for personal needs. When jobs were available in surrounding farms and communities, those willing to work beyond their regular CPS jobs could earn extra spending money. The federal government spent. million on the CPS program. The men performed million of unpaid labor in return. The first Civilian Public Service projects were in rural areas where the men performed tasks related to soil conservation, agriculture and forestry. Later men were assigned to projects in cities where they worked in hospitals, psychiatric wards, and university research centers. The CPS men discovered appalling conditions in the mental hospital wards. In an interview, a conscientious objector described his experience when he first entered a mental hospital in October One objector assigned to a violent ward refused to take the broomstick offered by the Charge. When he entered the ward the patients crowded around asking, Where is your broomstick, He said he thought he would not need it. But suppose some of us gang up on you, The CO guessed they wouldn t do that and started talking about other things. Within a few days the patients were seen gathering around the unarmed attendant telling him of their troubles. He felt much safer than the Charge who had only his broomstick for company. And the governor came in and they cleaned out the hospital. I mean, they had hearings. We all had to appear in court and all that kind of stuff. And within a month or so, the hospital was completely changed. The superintendent was fired and the new superintendent was put in, and not only did they do our hospital, they did all the hospitals, mental hospitals in Virginia. It couldn t happen today. Internal Review Boards would not permit the use of a live virus in human subjects unless they really understood what was going to happen to them. And I doubt that even if they knew what the risk was, that an Internal Review Board in any academic institution would consent to that kind of experimental work. Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the fields of literature. Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music, and the Irish language. The culture of the island also shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association football, rugby, horse racing, and golf. During the Iron Age, a Celtic language and culture emerged in Ireland. How and when the island of Ireland became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. Today, there is more than one school of thought on how this occurred in Ireland. The title of King of Ireland was re created in by Henry VIII, then King of England, of the Tudor dynasty. English rule of law was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the th century, leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland. A near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the th century, following the Nine Years War and the Flight of the Earls. Aside from the development of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital. The state was neutral during World War II, but offered clandestine assistance to the Allies, particularly in the potential defence of Northern Ireland. Despite their country s neutrality, approximately, volunteers from independent Ireland joined the British forces during the war, four being awarded Victoria Crosses. Large scale emigration marked most of the post WWII period particularly during the s and s, but beginning in the economy improved, and the s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the Celtic Tiger. The Republic s real GDP grew by an average of. per annum between and, in which year the Republic joined the euro. In, it was the sixth richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita. Social changes also occurred in this time, most markedly with the decline in authority of the Catholic Church. The financial crisis that began in dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by in and by. in, the worst year since records began although earnings by foreign owned businesses continued to grow. The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during, remaining above in. In the late s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by loyalist counter protests. The government s reaction to confrontations was seen to be one sided and heavy handed in favour of unionists. Law and order broke down as unrest and inter communal violence increased. The Northern Ireland government requested the British Army to aid the police, who were exhausted after several nights of serious rioting. In, the paramilitary Provisional IRA, which favoured the creation of a united Ireland, emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army and began a campaign against what it called the British occupation of the six counties. The Assembly and power sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland Operation Banner and began withdrawing troops. On June, Northern Ireland s deputy first minister and former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides. Both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union, and as a consequence there is free movement of people, goods, services and capital across the border. The Republic today ranks amongst the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita and in was ranked the seventh most developed nation in the world by the United Nations Human Development Index. A period of rapid economic expansion from onwards became known as the Celtic Tiger period, was brought to an end in with an unprecedented financial crisis and an economic depression in. Ultimately political power is held by the UK government, from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects of the UK House of Commons MPs. The Northern Ireland Secretary is a cabinet level post in the British government. Along with England, Wales and Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom as their court of final appeal. As part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all island institutions and areas of cooperation. The North South Inter Parliamentary Association is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures. There are two multi city regions on the island of Ireland Dublin Belfast corridor. m Cork Limerick Galway corridor m Below is a comparison of the Regional GDP on the island of Ireland. Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas. Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most. Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around days of the year are below freezing C F at inland weather stations, compared to days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves, most recently in, and. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of. Temperatures fell as low as. C F in County Mayo on December and up to a metre ft of snow fell in mountainous areas. World Heritage Sites The island has been invaded by some algae, some of which are now well established. For example The population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the th century. A population of over million in was reduced to slightly more than million by. In part, the fall in population was due to death from the Great Famine of to, which took about million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the st century. Emigration from Ireland in the th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, where a large Irish diaspora lives. As of,. million Canadians, or of the population, are of Irish descent. As of, a total of. million Americans claim Irish ancestry. With growing prosperity since the last decade of the th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in, Polish people have made up the largest number of immigrants over, from Central Europe. There has also been significant immigration from Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Latvia. The Irish language has a vast treasure of written texts from many centuries, and is divided by linguists into Old Irish from the th to th century, Middle Irish from the th to th century, Early Modern Irish until the th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from Latin, Old Norse, French and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early th century, and since then has been a minority language, although revival efforts are continuing in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Religion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times and since the th century plantations, has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island. Ireland s pre Christian heritage fused with the Celtic Church following the missions of Saint Patrick in the th century. The Hiberno Scottish missions, begun by the Irish monk Saint Columba, spread the Irish vision of Christianity to pagan England and the Frankish Empire. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the fall of Rome, earning Ireland the sobriquet, the island of saints and scholars. Ireland has nine universities, seven in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland, including Trinity College, Dublin and the University College Dublin, as well as numerous third level colleges and institutes and a branch of the Open University, the Open University in Ireland. In, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in, directed that the FAI s team be known only as Republic of Ireland and that the IFA s team be known as Northern Ireland with certain exceptions. Northern Ireland qualified for the World Cup finals in reaching the quarter finals, and. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in reaching the quarter finals, and the European Championships in and. Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the English and, to a lesser extent, Scottish soccer leagues. Horse racing and greyhound racing are both popular in Ireland. There are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well attended. The island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs. The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare. The obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown, accompanied by smaller craft, crossed the English Channel to the Atlantic coast of France and was rammed into the Normandie dock gates. The ship had been packed with delayed action explosives, well hidden within a steel and concrete case, that detonated later that day, putting the dock out of service for the remainder of the war and up to five years after. Combined Operations examined a number of options while planning the destruction of the dock. At this stage of the war the British government still tried to avoid civilian casualties. This ruled out a bombing attack by the RAF, which at the time did not possess the accuracy needed to destroy the dock without serious loss of civilian life. The Special Operations Executive were approached to see if its agents could destroy the dock gates. They decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them. The Royal Navy was also unable to mount an operation, as St Nazaire is km miles up the Loire estuary. Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range. The planners then examined whether a commando force was feasible to accomplish the task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through. The purpose of the raid was to destroy three objectives the Normandie dock, the old gates into the Bassin de St Nazaire together with the water pumping machinery and other installations, and any U boats or other shipping in the area. The initial Combined Operations plan required two specially lightened destroyers to carry out the raid. The first would be packed with explosives and rammed into the dock gates. Commandos on board would then disembark and use demolition charges to destroy nearby dock installations, searchlights and gun emplacements. The destroyer would then be blown up, and the second ship would come in and evacuate the ship s crew and the commandos. At the same time the RAF would carry out a number of diversionary air raids in the area. Combined Operations Headquarters worked closely with several intelligence organisations to plan the raid. The Naval Intelligence Division compiled information from a variety of sources. A detailed plan of the town of St Nazaire was provided by the Secret Intelligence Service, and information on the coastal artillery nearby was sourced from the War Office s Military Intelligence branch. Intelligence about the dock itself came from pre war technical journals. The man selected to lead the Commando force was Lieutenant Colonel Charles Newman his No. Commando would provide the largest Commandos contingent, men, for the raid. The Special Service Brigade headquarters used the raid to provide experience for their other units and men were drawn from Nos,,, and Commandos. There were only two other MLs in the vicinity ML had continued past the dock and was engaging targets upriver, ML appeared to be out of control and was running in circles. By this time the crew of Campbeltown had detonated the scuttling charges and gathered at the rear of the ship to be taken off. ML came alongside the destroyer and took men on board including Beattie and some of the wounded. Major Copland went through Campbeltown and evacuated the wounded towards the Old Mole, not knowing that there were no other boats there to take the Commandos off. Some Commandos were still ashore when Newman realised that evacuation by sea was no longer an option. He gathered the survivors and issued three orders To do our best to get back to England Not to surrender until all our ammunition is exhausted Not to surrender at all if we can help it. Newman and Copland led the charge from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and advanced into the new town. The Commandos attempted to get through the narrow streets of the town and into the surrounding countryside, but were eventually surrounded. When their ammunition was expended their only option was to surrender. Not all the Commandos were captured five men reached neutral Spain, from where they eventually returned to England. ML, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. ML, another torpedo armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire. After the Commando headquarters group had landed, Commander Ryder went to check for himself that Campbeltown was firmly stuck in the dock. Some of her surviving crewmen were being taken on board the MGB. Ryder returned to the boat and ordered the MTB to carry out its alternative task and torpedo the lock gates at the old entrance to the basin. After a successful torpedo attack, Ryder ordered the MTB to leave. On their way out of the estuary they stopped to collect survivors from a sinking ML and were hit and set on fire. Back at the docks the MGB had positioned itself in mid river to engage enemy gun emplacements. The forward pounder was manned by Able Seaman William Alfred Savage. Commander Ryder reported that Ryder could see no ships other than seven or eight burning MLs. He then realised that the landing places at the Old Mole and the entrance to the basin had both been recaptured by the Germans. There was nothing more they could do for the Commandos, so they headed out to sea. On their way they were continuously illuminated by German searchlights and were hit at least six times by the German guns. Passing ML, they ordered her to follow and made smoke to hide both boats. The explosive charges in HMS Campbeltown detonated at noon on March, and the dry dock was destroyed. Reports vary on the fate of the two tankers that were in the dock they were either swept away by the wall of water and sunk, or swept to the far end of the dock, but not sunk. A party of senior German officers and civilians who were on a tour of Campbeltown were killed. In total, the explosion killed about men. The wreck of Campbeltown could still be seen inside the dry dock months later when RAF photo reconnaissance planes were sent to photograph the port. St Nazaire was one of the battle honours presented to the Commandos after the war. The raid has since been called The Greatest Raid of All. The survivors formed their own association, the St Nazaire Society, which is a registered charity in the United Kingdom. A memorial to the raid erected in Falmouth bears the following inscription In memory of the Royal Navy Sailors and Army Commandos killed in the raid on St Nazaire on March The war film Attack on the Iron Coast was released in and was a highly fictionalized version of the raid. In, Jeremy Clarkson presented the story of the raid in a BBC documentary entitled The Greatest Raid of All Time. The series was the longest running and one of the most successful titles of DC s Vertigo imprint, and was the stepping stone to many British writers. Notable writers who have contributed to the series include Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis, Paul Jenkins, Warren Ellis, Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman, Mike Carey, Andy Diggle, and Peter Milligan. Hellblazer was one of the first modern occult detective fiction works and heavily influenced the genre to come. Many writers had lengthy runs on the series, such as Garth Ennis and Mike Carey, who respectively had the second and third longest runs on the book, only behind Peter Milligan. Other writers who wrote for the series include Paul Jenkins, Warren Ellis, Brian Azzarello, Neil Gaiman, Grant Morrison, Denise Mina, and Peter Milligan. Curtis Woodhouse born April is an English former professional footballer turned professional boxer and football manager. Most recently manager of Hull United, Woodhouse played football as a central midfielder, and competed as a light welterweight boxer. He is the former British light welterweight champion. His career in the Football League spanned across nine seasons, earning four caps for the England under football team. Woodhouse s professional boxing record stands at fights wins, of which are by knock out, and defeats. Woodhouse stated that he had fallen out of love with football and decided to turn to professional boxing, despite no previous experience. In September, he won his first professional boxing match, defeating Dean Marcantonio, on points, knocking him down twice in the final round. His only defeat was by Jay Morris in April, losing on points. Woodhouse began his football career at York City s centre of excellence in, before being transferred to Sheffield United for an initial compensation fee of,. Sheffield United and York City later agreed on an additional, fee plus a five percentage sell on clause. He made his debut for Sheffield United at the age of, coming on as a th minute substitute in a home win against Crewe Alexandra in the First Division on November. He made a total of nine First Division appearances in the season. Woodhouse holds the record for being the club s youngest ever captain, aged. He earned a call up to the England under team, and made his debut in a away draw against Hungary on April. He went on to earn another three caps against Sweden, Bulgaria and Poland in England s European Under Championship qualifying group. He made a total of appearances in the Football League, scoring six goals, before being sold to Birmingham City for million in February. Woodhouse signed for Peterborough United on October, the same day that he made his debut against Torquay United in a victory in the Football League Trophy. However, he had been training with Peterborough a month prior to signing for them, whilst he sorted out some problems at Birmingham City. He went on to captain the side, and was later described as Captain Marvel by manager, Barry Fry. In, he made appearances in the Second Division, scoring seven goals. Peterborough finished th in the Second Division, two points from relegation, with Woodhouse being named as Peterborough s player of the season. In May, Hull City manager, Peter Taylor, made a failed, bid to try and sign the midfielder. The following season, he made appearances in the newly named League One and scored four goals. Peterborough suffered relegation, after finishing rd in the league. He joined Hull City in May, the club he supported as a child, on a two year contract for a fee of, with the potential to rise to, depending on appearances. His debut for Hull was as a late substitute in a victory against Brighton Hove Albion on August. Though he lacked fitness at the start of the season, injuries to Keith Andrews and Ian Ashbee gave him the chance of a regular starting place, and manager Taylor also handed him the team captaincy. Despite consistent performances, by December he had lost his place and there was speculation that he had fallen out with Taylor and wanted to leave this was strongly denied by the player I m shocked that people are saying I want to go. I m very happy here.... It s taken me long enough to get to Hull so I m not going to walk out after a few months, or whatever. In the following six weeks he made only two brief substitute appearances in five months with the club he played games in the Championship without scoring and the strength of Hull s squad was such that he could not be guaranteed regular first team football. It was announced on May, that Woodhouse was the new manager of Northern Premier League Division One South club Sheffield. Woodhouse resigned in December after admitting having difficulty to managing a football team as well as being a professional boxer. As of January. Amongst the widespread devastation and damage throughout Port au Prince and elsewhere, vital infrastructure necessary to respond to the disaster was severely damaged or destroyed. This included all hospitals in the capital air, sea, and land transport facilities and communication systems. Minister of Education Joel Jean Pierre stated that the education system had totally collapsed. About half the nation s schools and the three main universities in Port au Prince were affected. More than, schools and health care facilities were destroyed. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti MINUSTAH at Christopher Hotel and offices of the World Bank were destroyed. The building housing the offices of Citibank in Port au Prince collapsed, killing five employees. The clothing industry, which accounts for two thirds of Haiti s exports, reported structural damage at manufacturing facilities. The earthquake caused an urgent need for outside rescuers to communicate with Haitians whose main or only language is Haitian Creole. As a result, a mobile translation program to translate between English and Haitian Creole had to be written quickly. The earthquake struck in the most populated area of the country. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimated that as many as million people had been affected by the quake. In mid February, the Haitian government reported the death toll to have reached,. However, an investigation by Radio Netherlands has questioned the official death toll, reporting an estimate of, deaths as being a more realistic figure. On the first anniversary of the earthquake, January, Haitian Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive said the death toll from the quake was more than, raising the figures from previous estimates. From January, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been working in Haiti since, focused on bringing emergency assistance to victims of the catastrophe, in close cooperation with its partners within the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, particularly the Haitian Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. International rescue efforts were restricted by traffic congestion and blocked roads. Although US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had previously ruled out dropping food and water by air as too dangerous, by January, US helicopters were distributing aid to areas impossible to reach by land. In Jacmel, a city of, the mayor claimed that percent of the homes had been damaged and that the quake had killed to people and left some, injured. The small airstrip suffered damage that rendered it unusable for supply flights until January. The Canadian navy vessel HMCS Halifax was deployed to the area on January the Canadians joined Colombian rescue workers, Chilean doctors, a French mobile clinic, and Sri Lankan relief workers who had already responded to calls for aid. Social networking organizations such as Crisis Camp Haiti were developed to aid in the structure and coordination of relief efforts in Haiti and future catastrophic events as well. On April, due to the potential threat of mudslides and flooding from the upcoming rainy season, the Haitian government began operations to move thousands of refugees to a more secure location north of the capital. Prime Minister Bellerive announced that from January, people would be helped to relocate outside the zone of devastation, to areas where they may be able to rely on relatives or better fend for themselves people who have been made homeless would be relocated to the makeshift camps created by residents within the city, where a more focused delivery of aid and sanitation could be achieved. Port au Prince, according to an international studies professor at the University of Miami, was ill equipped before the disaster to sustain the number of people who had migrated there from the countryside over the past ten years to find work. After the earthquake, thousands of Port au Prince residents began returning to the rural towns they came from. On January a one day conference was held in Montreal to assess the relief effort and discuss further plans. Prime Minister Bellerive told delegates from countries that Haiti would need massive support for its recovery from the international community. A donors conference was expected to be held at the UN headquarters in New York in March, however, took more than three months to hold the UN conference. The member international Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission, headed by Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive, convened in June. That committee is overseeing the US. billion pledged internationally for the first two years of Haiti s reconstruction. On January, the Catholic Relief Services announced a US million, five year relief and reconstruction program that covers shelter, health, livelihoods, and child protection among its program areas. In October, a cholera epidemic broke out, probably introduced by foreign aid workers. Cholera most often affects poor countries with limited access to clean water and proper sanitation. By the end of, more than, had died at a rate of about deaths a day. On August, recovery was hampered due to Tropical Storm Isaac impacting Haiti s southern peninsula. There it caused flooding and deaths according to local reporting. As a result of the earthquake, more than, Haitians continue to live in tents and experienced the storm without adequate shelter. In late October, with over, still living in tent camps, a second tropical storm, Hurricane Sandy, killed and left large portions of Haiti under water. Darden was ranked th on the Cleveland Browns top players list. While staying true to most adventure game conventions, Voyage has some unique features for its genre. These include two dexterity minigames which take advantage of the reduced gravity in the game s lunar setting, and an Intelligence Management System, in which a score is assigned to the player for every puzzle he solves, and for certain actions. The Adventure Company introduced this feature to motivate players to replay the game to increase their cumulative score. Voyage features two unique dexterity minigames. Using a low gravity setting, the first minigame requires the player to collect floating bubbles in a can, and the second requires the player to execute large jumps across the surface of the moon. These two minigames form only a minor part of the game. The game also has several timed sequences requiring the player to complete puzzles under a time limit. The consequence of failing a puzzle of this sort is death, after which the player is able to return and replay the puzzle. Players can also be killed as the result of taking incorrect actions related to the game s story. A critical aspect of gameplay in Voyage is the inventory system, which allows the player to pick up and keep dozens of different items. However, the maximum quantity of a given item that the player may keep in his inventory at any one time is three. One of the main uses of the inventory is to combine items together to make new items. This process of breaking and reforming items in the inventory comprises a large portion of the puzzle aspect of the game. The inventory can also be used to create meals which the player can consume this ability plays a major role in several puzzles. Another use of the inventory is to create hybrid lunar plants, which play a critical role in the earlier puzzles of the game. Voyage is set in. President Barbicane of the Gun Club decides to build an enormous cannon in Baltimore to shoot a shell, capable of supporting human life, towards the moon in the hopes of a successful landing. Voyage s protagonist, Michel Ardan, volunteers to travel in the aluminium shell. After the game s brief introduction in the shell, Ardan lands on the moon and discovers the Selenites, as well as a complex ecosystem of lunar plants. The main accessible areas in the game are the moon s surface, and the underground Selenite civilization. Journey to the Center of the Moon was announced for the PC at E. The Adventure Company collaborated with developers Kheops Studios for the release. Benot Hozjan, the co founder of Kheops Studio, became Managing Director of the game, while Alexis Lang became the Lead Game Designer. Journey to the Center of the Moon was later renamed Voyage Inspired by Jules Verne. Benot Hozjan explained the change, saying that Journey to the Center of the Moon seems to be confusing and some people thought that it could be the sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth, another Verne inspired PC game, so marketing decided to change it. The name was changed on July, a few months after the game s announcement. Old Baltimore Pike is a road in the U.S. state of Delaware. The road, known as New Castle County Road, runs from Maryland Route MD at the Maryland state line south of Newark, Delaware and continues east to Christiana, ending near Delaware Route DE. The road is paralleled by Interstate I, Delaware Turnpike to the north and U.S. Route US, Pulaski Highway to the south. The Old Baltimore Pike was built before and connected Elkton, Maryland to Christiana. It was a turnpike called the Elk and Christiana Turnpike between and. In the past it served as a major connection between Philadelphia and Baltimore. The road, also known as Old Post Road, was incorporated in as the Elk and Christiana Turnpike in order to get more money for repairs. The turnpike was completed in April. As a turnpike, tolls were collected to pay for the maintenance of the road. The construction of the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad lowered the revenues of the turnpike and it became a public road again in. The road historically went through agricultural areas however, the surroundings have become more developed over the years. Much of the Old Baltimore Pike remains two lanes. The entire route is in New Castle County. After defeating the evil Dr. Wily many times, the robotic hero Mega Man is called into action once again when a powerful being known as King steals the blueprints to the creations of Dr. Wily and Dr. Light in order to create an army for robotic dominance over humans. Having learned of the threat, Mega Man s rival Bass decides to take matters into his own hands. The game is an action platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons. Mega Man Bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters, each of which plays differently from the other. The gameplay in Mega Man Bass is similar to earlier games in the series. The player is tasked with completing a series of action platform stages while overcoming obstacles, solving minor puzzles, and battling enemies. Destroying the Robot Master boss at the end of a stage lets the player acquire its special weapon. In previous games, the player generally took on the role of the hero Mega Man. In this game, the player can choose to start the game as either Mega Man or Bass. However, whichever character is picked must be used for the rest of the game and cannot be changed. Mega Man is able to charge his shots to make them more powerful and has the ability to slide along the ground. Bass is able to rapidly fire his arm cannon in eight directions, though shots cannot be fired while moving or pass through walls unless a certain upgrade is obtained. Bass is also able to double jump jump a second time in mid air and dash along the ground. Performing both simultaneously lets him cross great distances by doing a dash jump. Mega Man Bass was originally available in Japan through the Nintendo Power game service in Lawson convenience stores. Its popularity prompted Capcom to later release the game in Super Famicom cartridge form. Until its GBA re release, it was one of the few Mega Man titles not localized for English speaking countries. The company commemorated the th anniversary of the Mega Man franchise with the GBA version of the game. Elements of the game appeared in the Mega Man comic series from Archie Comics before it went on hiatus. Most notably, King appeared during a time travel story in issue, while issue saw Dr. Light experiencing a vision of the events of the game among other yet to be adapted games. State Route SR is a very short, two lane state highway in the western portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. A spur route, SR has its western terminus at an abandoned railroad grade just west of Washington Street in the village of Burkettsville. Its eastern terminus is. miles. km to the east of its western terminus at its junction with SR. SR was established in the early s. It started out as a much longer highway, but earlier segments would become a part of SR in the late s. For its entire length, SR runs along the boundary between Darke County on the south side and Mercer County on the north side. SR begins in downtown Burkettsville at a former railroad grade just west of Washington Street. Known as Main Street within Burkettsville, the route runs due east through the village s central business district prior to entering a residential area where it intersects a few side streets. After leaving the village of Burkettsville, SR becomes the boundary between Darke County s Allen Township and Mercer County s Granville Township. After a short distance through farmland, the highway comes to an end as it arrives at its junction with SR. Continuing east after the route terminates is Darke Mercer County Line Road. The Act effectively removed the right of the Lords to veto money bills completely, and replaced a right of veto over other public bills with a maximum delay of two years. It also reduced the maximum term of a parliament from seven years to five. The bill was also an attempt to place the relationship between the House of Commons and House of Lords on a new footing. As well as the direct issue of money Bills, it set new conventions about how the power the Lords continued to hold would be used. It did not change the composition of the Lords, however. It was used in relation to the Government of Ireland Act, which had been under the threat of a Lords veto, now removed. Ulster Protestants had been firmly against the passing of the bill. However, it never came into force because of the outbreak of the First World War. Amendments to the Parliament Act were made to prolong the life of the parliament following the outbreak of the First World War and parliament because of the Second World War. These made special exemptions to the requirement to hold an election every five years. It is also mentioned in discussion of constitutional convention. Whilst it replaced conventions regarding the role of the House of Lords, it also relies on several others. Section only makes sense if money bills do not arise in the House of Lords and the provisions in section only if proceedings on a public bill are completed in a single session, otherwise they must fail and be put through procedure again. Zoe Williams also reviewed the restaurant shortly after it arrived in London, for The Daily Telegraph. She enjoyed her visit, and was impressed with the unusual combinations of foods that worked together saying the sheer expertise of taking a food with a range of flavours, and knowing it s in peak condition to meet four others... it really is something. The restaurant made its first entry in the World s Best Restaurants in, ranked in th place and one of three British restaurants in the list the following year it moved up to rd. The Good Food Guide ranked Hibiscus as the eighth best restaurant in the UK in its guide. Chris Turner born September, is an American football quarterback. He played quarterback for the Maryland Terrapins at the University of Maryland from to. Turner began his career at Maryland as a redshirt in and then served as a reserve quarterback before he earned the starting position. The first and most commonly repeated verse is Jack and Jill went up the hill Jack fell down and broke his crown, And Jill came tumbling after. Up Jack got, and home did trot, With vinegar and brown paper. By the early th century this had been modified in some collections, such as L. E. Walter s, Mother Goose s Nursery Rhymes London, to Up Jack got and home did trot, And went to bed and bound his head With vinegar and brown paper. To see Jack s paper plaster For laughing at Jack s disaster. Twentieth century versions of this verse include To see Jack s paper plaster For causing Jack s disaster. It has also been suggested that the rhyme records the attempt by King Charles I to reform the taxes on liquid measures. He was blocked by Parliament, so subsequently ordered that the volume of a Jack pint be reduced, but the tax remained the same. This meant that he still received more tax, despite Parliament s veto. Hence Jack fell down and broke his crown many pint glasses in the UK still have a line marking the pint level with a crown above it and Jill came tumbling after. The reference to Jill actually a gill, or pint is said to reflect that the gill dropped in volume as a consequence. The entire route is in Miami Dade County. All exits are unnumbered. Nesbitt is married to former actress Sonia Forbes Adam, with whom he has two daughters. He is an advocate of numerous charities, and in he accepted the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster. In, Nesbitt appeared in Wall of Silence, a fact based drama about the aftermath of the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy s father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly what happened to his son. He had only just completed Bloody Sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe s fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe s South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year. Since Nesbitt appears in adverts for Thomas Cook. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire OBE in the New Year Honours for services to drama and to the community in Northern Ireland. Chancellor of the University of Ulster ceremonial Columbia Records released Crazy in Love on May, as the lead single from Dangerously in Love. It was a number one hit in the United States and United Kingdom, and achieved top ten peaks on several other countries record charts. With global sales of over. million, including million from the U.S., it is one of the best selling singles of all time. Music critics praised Crazy in Love s hook, Jay Z s contribution, and Beyonc s assertive delivery of the lyrics. VH declared it the greatest song of the s decade, while Rolling Stone ranked it as the th best song of all time in. At the th Grammy Awards, Crazy in Love won Best R B Song and Best Rap Sung Collaboration. Harrison confessed that it was not easy for him to come up with the lyrics to Crazy in Love in that length of time. Two hours later, he had penned the verses and the hook in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made provision for a backing track he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyonc, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy as she kept saying, I m looking so crazy right now. Harrison sang back to her and said, That s the hook. It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyonc had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase Uh oh, uh oh, you know alongside Harrison. American rapper Jay Z became involved late in the song s production. Around three in the morning, he came to the studio and recorded a rap verse, which he improvised in about ten minutes. The recording of Crazy in Love took place nearly three months following the meeting of Beyonc with Harrison.

Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were captured by the end of December, general exhaustion among the Allied forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When harsh winter weather set in, it became clear to the Allied generals that no further progress would be made and Alexander called off the offensive. Montgomery s plan was for the Canadian Division to attack across the Moro in the coastal lowlands to take Ortona first and then Pescara. Inland, in the jagged hills above the headwaters of the Moro, the relatively fresh nd New Zealand Division would attack toward Orsogna, while between these two the th Indian Infantry Division would hold the centre of the front in a relatively static role. On December, Canadian forces began a series of large scale assaults on major crossing points along the Moro River with the objective of securing a large bridgehead along the defensive line. Three primary points of attack were chosen Villa Rogatti, along the western edge of the Canadian sector San Leonardo, km. mi south of Ortona and San Donato, a small town near the Italian coast. Five primary infantry battalions were selected to assault these positions with the objective of crossing the Moro River. The offensives were scheduled to start on the morning of December. By mid morning, German counterattacks on PPCLI positions in the town had begun, involving tanks from the th Company of the th Panzer Regiment. Panzer Regiment, field guns and substantial infantry forces. Throughout the afternoon two infantry companies of the PPCLI fought off several attacks by German forces, eventually managing to push them back to the vineyards on the northern edge of the town. While the PPCLI had taken casualties, German casualties were estimated at. However, three strong German formation surrounded the Canadian positions at Villa Rogatti, rendering further exploitation of the bridgehead unlikely. Col. Ware was advised to be ready to withdraw across the Moro River, should German forces counterattack. In order to allow the Canadian Division a greater concentration of force, on the night of December, the Indian st Infantry Brigade from the Indian th Infantry Division amalgamated the western flank of the st Canadian Division into their own lines. As a result of the withdrawal, Canadian efforts would focus on achieving a bridgehead at San Leonardo. The Canadian attack on San Leonardo by the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada began late on December with A Company establishing a bridgehead across the Moro, taking heavy casualties. In the early morning of December, A Company was withdrawn and two additional Seaforth companies resumed the offensive. As PPCLI secured and held their bridgehead over the Moro River, the Seaforth Highlanders were struggling to enter San Leonardo. By, a single objective had been taken, with Canadian units pinned down by well coordinated defensive fire from several companies of the st Regiment. Simultaneously, small arms fire prevented C Company from moving up the road from the Moro to San Leonardo, while D Company remained on the southern banks of the Moro throughout the early morning. While attempts were made to cross the Moro at San Leonardo and Villa Rogatti, The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment launched an attack on the Moro River defences at the small coastal hamlet of San Donato at on December. However, the single rifle company making the attack achieved little territorial gain and Lieutenant Colonel Kennedy commander of the Hastings Prince Edward Regiment ordered a withdrawal at. Throughout December, strong German coastal defences would prevent further advancement, despite the incorporation of tanks and artillery into the assault. By nightfall, the German defenders still possessed control of San Donato, with the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment withdrawing to the southern bank of the Moro River. On December, Major General Vokes devised a new plan for taking the Moro River. While the th Highlanders of Canada and Princess Patricia s Canadian Light Infantry resumed the assault on San Leonardo from the southwest side of the town, the Royal Canadian Regiment RCR would break out of the bridgehead created by the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, then move southwest towards San Leonardo to link up with the th and PPCLI. The operation was scheduled to start on the afternoon of December. As the th Highlanders secured their positions west of San Leonardo, the Royal Canadian Regiment was involved in intense fighting southwest of San Donato. Two companies had advanced against strong and well prepared German defences of the th Panzergrenadier Regiment. A Company was quickly tied down by German mortar fire, while B Company flanked German positions to the north of San Donato. By nightfall, all four companies held tenuous positions in the thick of German defences. On the night of December, the RCR was subjected to counterattacks by the th Panzergrenadier Regiment which were repulsed with the support of continuous Canadian artillery shelling. With the Indian Division committed, Montgomery decided to raise the stakes further by bringing the British th Infantry Division from the relatively tranquil XIII Corps front in the high mountains on the left wing of the th Army and insert them between the New Zealand and Indian Divisions. This would allow the Indian division to narrow and concentrate their attack and give Montgomery four divisions to continue the attack between Orsogna and the sea. By December, the British th Infantry Brigade the first of th Division s brigades was in place and under the New Zealand division s command. Once th Division headquarters and its other brigades had arrived, these two left hand divisions were to be organised under the command of XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey. Operation Florence had come to an end. While the German line had been pushed back and they had sustained casualties they could ill afford, they still firmly held Orsogna. Furthermore, the New Zealand Division was, for the time being, fought out and needed a period of consolidation and reorganisation. In preparation for what he hoped would be the final attack on The Gully, Vokes shifted the nd Canadian Infantry Brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the st Brigade. Vokes planned for an attack by The Carleton and York Regiment to be the last of the frontal assaults against The Gully. Should this attack fail, the st Brigade s Seaforth Highlanders and the Royal Canadian Regiment would move through Casa Berardi and outflank German defences, forcing a withdrawal from The Gully. At on December, two companies of the Carleton and York Regiment attacked. After little more than an hour of fighting, however, the Canadians were forced to call the attack off. In the afternoon, the two heavily depleted companies of the Royal e Rgiment fought off a large German counterattack on Casa Berardi, with the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery firing, rounds in support of Canadian forces. Berkley Warren Bedell born March, is a former U.S. Representative from Iowa. After starting a successful business in his youth, Berkley Fly Co., he ran for the United States Congress in, but was defeated by incumbent Wiley Mayne. In, however, Bedell beat Wiley Mayne and was elected to Congress. He was known for his support of representative democracy and his populist style. For example, he would hold town halls and let constituents vote on motions to decide what he would do in Congress on their behalf. These meetings helped Bedell understand the problems of his constituents as a result, he backed issues that were important to his farming constituency, such as waterway usage fees and production constraints. During his time at Congress, Bedell took efforts to uphold representative democracy. He held town halls regularly with his constituents, and he would let them vote on motions to decide what he would do in Congress on their behalf. This type of communication told Bedell of the types of issues affecting his farming constituency. Thus, though Bedell had not farmed in his life, he would take steps in Congress to benefit farmers. Bedell sponsored several bold initiatives during his tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in that would require the barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell s original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate. On the other hand, opponents of the Bedell plan had a very different view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill was an example of the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell s plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed. Bart vs. Australia is the sixteenth episode of the sixth season of The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February,. In the episode, Bart is indicted for fraud in Australia, and the family travels to the country so Bart can apologize. The Australian Parliament decides to give him the additional punishment of a boot to his buttocks, but the Simpson family refuses. Bart later changes his mind and agrees to the punishment, but just as he is about to receive it, he moons the Australians and the family flee back to America. The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein and directed by Wes Archer. It features cultural references to films such as Mad Max and Crocodile Dundee. Bart vs. Australia acquired a Nielsen rating of. and was the fourth highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. It received mixed reception in Australia, with some Australian viewers saying the episode was a mockery of their country. The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. The writing staff wanted to do an episode where the Simpsons family traveled to Australia, because they thought everyone in Australia had a good sense of humor and that they would get the jokes. The staff had previously poked fun at several American institutions on the show and they thought it would be interesting to poke fun at a whole nation. They designed Australia and the Australian people very inaccurately and many things were completely made up for fun. The animators, however, got two Australian tourist guides to help them out with the design of the Australian landscape and buildings, as well as the American Embassy. The writers did research on the Coriolis effect for this episode. Lisa s explanation of the effect is incorrect it affects global weather patterns and is caused by the spinning of the globe on its axis. The amount of water in a toilet or sink is much too small to be affected by it. In, Fox Studios Australia in Sydney used a different version of Bart vs. Australia as part of their Simpsons attraction, called The Simpsons Down Under. They had contacted the Simpsons writing staff and asked if they would write the screenplay for a ride in their attraction, based on this episode. The episode was re edited and re animated for the ride and new scenes were included. The attraction featured motion capture technology, allowing audience members faces and expressions to be transformed into moving cartoon characters. In its original American broadcast, Bart vs. Australia finished th in the ratings for the week of February, with a Nielsen rating of.. It was the fourth highest rated show on Fox that week. The episode has since become study material for sociology courses at the University of California, where it is used to examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show, and to figure out what it is trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from fans and television critics. In a DVD review of the sixth season, Ryan Keefer said all the Australian jabs you expect to have here are present. Bart s international incident is hilarious, from top to bottom. The phone calls he makes to other countries particularly Buenos Aires are fantastic. This is one of the more under appreciated episodes in the series run. Vanity Fair named it the second best episode of The Simpsons in. Bart vs. Australia was also nominated for an Emmy Award in in the category Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special.

Andrew volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force NZEF in October. Because only men between the ages of and were required to register for service with the NZEF, he falsified his age to ensure that he would be eligible for duty overseas. A member of the th Reinforcements, he embarked for the Western Front via Egypt on May. In France, he was posted to B Company, Wellington Infantry Battalion with the rank of private. It was for his leadership and bravery during these actions that Andrew was awarded the Victoria Cross VC at the age of. The citation read as follows Andrew was promoted to sergeant the day after his VC winning action. He continued to serve on the front until early, when he was sent to England for officer training. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in March, but remained in England until the end of the war. The battalion embarked for England in May as part of th Infantry Brigade, nd New Zealand Division. Arriving in June, it spent the remainder of the year on garrison duties in the south of England. In March it travelled for Egypt and then onto Greece. Andrew led the battalion through the subsequent Battle of Greece, during which it saw little action, and the Battle of Crete. When The Jackson parted with their record label Motown in, they signed to CBS Records and rebranded themselves as The Jacksons. Additionally, the brothers were signed to CBS TV to star with their family in a variety series called The Jacksons. The shows premiered in June, and featured all of the siblings excluding Jermaine, who had chosen to stay with Motown. The initial series run of the minute programs was four weeks. Due to ratings success, more episodes were ordered in January. The shows marked the first time that an African American family had ever starred in a television series. The run of programs concluded shortly afterward. Following years of preparation, Jackson s debut album Centipede was distributed in October by CBS Records, who had signed her as a solo artist two years previously. The album was only released once the singer had ensured that family life was secure and that she had spent time with her children during their important younger years. Centipede became a moderate chart success, reaching number on Billboard s Top R B Hip Hop Albums chart and number on its Top. The recording of the album had been a family affair it involved several contributions from her relatives. Her husband Nathaniel Brown co wrote the song Come Alive Saturday Night with two of his wife s brothers Randy and Tito. The latter Jackson also penned Hey Boy with his wife Dee Dee. The most successful song from the album was the million selling title track, Centipede. Written, arranged and produced by Michael, the song also featured Jackson s famous brother on backing vocals. It reached number on the Black Singles Chart and was subsequently certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Centipede marked Michael s first effort at writing and producing since the release of his successful Thriller. Rebbie later revealed that there was a lot of discussion at the time of the release of Centipede over whether she should use the Jackson surname professionally or not. To begin with Rebbie did not want to use her pre marriage surname, but later reasoned that it was silly to deny her heritage. Jackson explained that she did, however, compromise with the use of her family name on the Centipede album cover Rebbie is large and Jackson is small. She further stated that the success of siblings Michael and Janet had not been a hindrance to her, but served as an enhancement to her career. Rebbie added that she did not have to worry about name recognition. Hugh Foliot c. was a medieval Bishop of Hereford. Related somehow to his predecessor at Hereford, he served as a priest and papal judge as well as being an unsuccessful candidate as Bishop of St David s in Wales.

He helped found a hospital and a priory, and died in after a months long illness. Production of an updated four door second generation model commenced in despite some mixed messages from the Storm s primary customer, the Israel Defense Forces. Development of a third generation vehicle based on the new Jeep Wrangler JK has been completed and significant production for both Israeli and foreign customers is under way. The two production frame lengths,.. and. metres. ft, the latter of which was among the few such Jeep derivatives in production in recent years, were both available in civilian and military models. Aside from the Israeli market, Storms have long been exported to countries in South America, Asia, and Africa. A Jeep managed production line in Egypt, whose vehicles are used by the Egyptian armed forces, was absorbed into the AIL Storm production after it closed in. As with several analogous light military vehicles, despite being originally designed to fill a light reconnaissance role, the rise of urban warfare and close quarters combat meant that the Israel Defense Forces had to recast the Storm in new roles. The commander version incorporates a door hard top cab allowing for the quick and convenient entrance and exit of the driver and all passengers or troops. A large rear compartment enables the storage of both cargo and communications equipment. The Storm reconnaissance and patrol model allows for extra stowage of fuel, water and equipment. This version is especially suited to be fitted with various machine gun or special equipment mountings. The Atlantic hurricane season was a generally average period of tropical cyclogenesis in. Though the season had no official bounds, most tropical cyclone activity occurred during August and September. Throughout the year, fourteen tropical cyclones formed, of which nine reached tropical storm intensity six were hurricanes. None of the hurricanes reached major hurricane intensity. Tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes, especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration, may have remained undetected. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a reanalysis project which analyzed the season in, an additional hurricane was added to HURDAT. The year s first tropical storm formed on May off the northern coast of Hispaniola. At the time, this was a rare occurrence, as only four other tropical disturbances were known to have formed prior during this period since then, reanalysis of previous seasons has concluded that there were more than four tropical cyclones in May before. The season s final system was a tropical disturbance situated in the Greater Antilles, which dissipated on November. On August, an extratropical cyclone developed into a tropical depression off the west coast of Florida. Initially a weak disturbance, it moved generally westward, slowly gaining in intensity. Early on August, the depression attained tropical storm intensity. Ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested. After reaching hurricane strength on August south of the Mississippi River Delta, the storm strengthened further into a modern day Category hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of mph and a minimum barometric pressure of mbar hPa. inHg at UTC on August. The hurricane moved ashore near Sabine Pass, Texas later that day at peak strength. Once inland, the storm executed a sharp curve to the north and quickly weakened, degenerating into a tropical storm on August before dissipating over Arkansas on August. Poems. and line My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, O for a draught of vintage, that hath been That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, And with thee fade away into the forest dim The weariness, the fever, and the fret Where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, Away, away, for I will fly to thee, Already with thee, tender is the night, But here there is no light, Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, The grass, the thicket, and the fruit tree wild And mid May s eldest child, To take into the air my quiet breath Now more than ever seems it rich to die, To cease upon the midnight with no pain, While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad In such an ecstasy, The voice I hear this passing night was heard In ancient days by emperor and clown Perhaps the self same song that found a path Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, She stood in tears amid the alien corn To toll me back from thee to my sole self, Past the near meadows, over the still stream, Up the hill side and now tis buried deep Was it a vision, or a waking dream, John Scott, in an anonymous review for the September edition of The London Magazine, argued for the greatness of Keats s poetry as exemplified by poems including Ode to a Nightingale HMS Marlborough was an Iron Duke class battleship of the British Royal Navy, named in honour of John Churchill, st Duke of Marlborough. She was built at Devonport Royal Dockyard between January and June, entering service just before the outbreak of the First World War. She was armed with a main battery of ten. inch mm guns and was capable of a top speed of. knots. km h. mph. After the war, Marlborough was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea in. She was also involved in the Greco Turkish War. In, the London Naval Treaty mandated that the four Iron Duke class battleships be discarded Marlborough was used for a variety of weapons tests in, the results of which were incorporated into the reconstruction programme for the Queen Elizabeth class battleships. At, Marlborough engaged Wiesbaden again, firing four salvos at ranges of, to, yards, to, m. She hit the German cruiser with probably three shells from the last two salvos and these finally neutralised the ship, although it took several more hours before Wiesbaden sank. Marlborough then shifted fire to the Knig class battleships leading the German line at. She fired thirteen salvos in the span of six minutes at SMS Grosser Kurfrst at ranges of, to, yards, to, m, scoring three hits, though she incorrectly claimed a fourth hit. During this phase of the battle, Marlborough fired two torpedoes, both of which missed their targets the first at Wiesbaden at and the second at SMS Kaiser at. By this time, however, North Korean logistics had been stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult. By the beginning of August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they could find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the th troops. The th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves. At dawn on August, one man battalion of the th Regiment entered the village of P ohang, creating a state of alarm among its populace. The village was only protected by a small force of South Korean Navy, Air Force and Army personnel comprising the rear guard of the ROK rd Division. The South Korean forces engaged the th forces around the village s middle school with small arms fire until noon. At that point, North Korean armored vehicles moved in to reinforce the th troops and drove the South Koreans out of the village. Brown and his wives have said they participated with the show to make the public more aware of polygamist families and to combat societal prejudices. Brown believes his polygamist arrangement is legal because he is legally married only to one woman, and the other marriages are spiritual unions. The series led to the Brown family being investigated for possible prosecution. The show follows the lives of advertising salesman Kody Brown, his wives Meri, Janelle, Christine, and Robyn, and their children. In the first season the show televised Brown s courting and marriage of his fourth wife, Robyn Sullivan, in. Sullivan was the first new wife to enter the family in years.

Gilbert was mostly collaborative with Dahl s work, as the writer declared He not only helped in script conferences, but had some good ideas and then left you alone, and when you produced the finished thing, he shot it. Other directors have such an ego that they want to rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it s usually disastrous. What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That s the way to direct You either trust your writer or you don t. There are two versions of the song You Only Live Twice, sung by Nancy Sinatra, one directly from the movie soundtrack, and a second one for record release arranged by Billy Strange. The movie soundtrack song is widely recognised for its striking opening bars and oriental flavour, and was far more popular on radio. The record release made No. on the Billboard charts in the USA, No. in UK. Both versions of the title song are available on CD. The planet orbits at approximately of the distance between the Sun and Earth every four days. The star was observed several times between and, at first through the SuperWASP program and later through focused follow up observations. Analysis of collected radial velocity measurements led to the discovery of WASP b, which was reported in a journal on April,. A follow up study published in investigated the cause for inflated planets such as WASP b, and re examined and re constrained its mass, radius, density, and age. WASP has an apparent magnitude of., making it invisible to the unaided eye as seen from Earth. The band first became involved with Sarajevo in on their Zoo TV Tour approached by aid worker Bill Carter about bringing attention to the Siege of Sarajevo, the band conducted nightly satellite transmissions with Bosnians during their shows. These link ups were the subject of criticism from journalists for mixing entertainment with human tragedy. Although the war made it impractical for U to visit Sarajevo at the time, they vowed to eventually play a concert in the city. After the conflict ended in November, they made arrangements to visit Sarajevo, and with help from United Nations ambassadors and peacekeeping troops, they scheduled and played the concert in. Bono agreed to Carter s request without asking the rest of the band, and when informed of the idea, the other members gave only tacit approval. They briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city, with Bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where Carter and his friends hid during the siege. He said, even if all we get is some extra attention for Bosnia on MTV, that s something. The idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible, as the only way into Sarajevo was on a United Nations plane. Manager Paul McGuinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert, it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the Zoo TV crew. As he explained, U s effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that U is also obliged to resolve that issue. Going to Sarajevo seems to me to fall into that category. I think it would endanger the people we go with, endanger the tour, and endanger the band. Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. feared that the move would look like a publicity stunt. The peaceful nature of the U concert was fleeting, as violence flared up in the region the following year with the Kosovo War. NATO troops remained in Sarajevo until, while European Union peace keeping troops remain in the city. The railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened. The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in amid fears that another slide was possible. The town s population nearly doubled its pre slide population by, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in. The community is now part of the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass in the Province of Alberta and has a population around. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination. It has been designated a Provincial Historic Site of Alberta and is home to an interpretive centre that receives over, visitors annually. The slide created two new peaks on the mountain the south peak stands, metres, ft high and the north peak, metres, ft. Geologists believe that another slide is inevitable, though not imminent. The south peak is considered the most likely to fall it would likely create a slide about one sixth the size of the slide. The mountain, continuously monitored for changes in stability, has been studied on numerous occasions. The Alberta Geological Survey operates a state of the art monitoring system used by researchers around the world. Over monitoring stations have been placed on the face of the mountain to provide an early warning system for area residents in case of another slide. Secondary structure regularly repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds. The most common examples are the helix, sheet and turns. Because secondary structures are local, many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule. The molecules bound and acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist of hundreds of amino acids, it is usually only a small fraction of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction three to four residues on average that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site. A vast array of computational methods have been developed to analyze the structure, function, and evolution of proteins.

She mentioned that she sang that song in a way that she felt the conflicts that were present in the story and with the strength that was part of the show s theme. With regards to the song s music video, she wanted to have a video which would express in color emotions, such as the use of red to represent confrontations, black to represent the feeling of being lost, and green for frightening things. In making the single Bright Flight L. Miranic, she mentions in an interview with HMV Japan that the concept of the single is that it can be divided into two parts pink and black. Pink is the color of Bright Flight, a song which is in a pop style and was written in a cute image in mind, while black is the color of L. Miranic, which is in a dark rock style and has the theme of a bad woman. LiSA mentioned that the name L. Miranic was chosen because the song is linked to criminals and that since Miranic is a name in some countries, adding her name to Miranic to make LiSA Miranic would mean that the criminal in the song is her. The discography of LiSA includes three studio albums, one extended play, ten singles, and five video albums.

Villa won the European Cup, and are thus one of five English clubs to win what is now the UEFA Champions League. They have the fifth highest total of major honours won by an English club, having won the First Division Championship seven times, the FA Cup seven times, the Football League Cup five times, and the European Cup and UEFA Super Cup double in. They have a fierce local rivalry with Birmingham City. The Second City derby between Aston Villa and Birmingham City has been played since. The club s traditional kit colours are claret shirts with sky blue sleeves, white shorts and sky blue socks. Their traditional badge is of a rampant lion, which was introduced by the club s Scottish chairman William McGregor in honour of the Royal Standard of Scotland. The club won their first FA Cup in with captain Archie Hunter becoming one of the game s first household names. Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in with one of the club s directors, William McGregor being the league s founder. Aston Villa emerged as the most successful English club of the Victorian era, winning no fewer than five League titles and three FA Cups by the end of Queen Victoria s reign. In, the year Villa won The Double, they moved into their present home, the Aston Lower Grounds. Supporters coined the name Villa Park no official declaration listed the ground as Villa Park. Mercer s forced retirement from the club in signalled a period of deep turmoil. The most successful club in England was struggling to keep pace with changes in the modern game, with Villa being relegated for the third time, under manager Dick Taylor in. The following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked Tommy Cummings the manager brought in to replace Taylor, and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans. After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who also brought in Doug Ellis as chairman. However, new ownership could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time at the end of the season. However, Villa gradually began to recover under the management of former club captain Vic Crowe. In the season they returned to the Second Division as Champions with a record points. In, Ron Saunders was appointed manager. His brand of no nonsense man management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, at the end of season, he had taken them back into the First Division and into Europe. i Proposed and seconded that the colours be chocolate and sky blue shirts and that we order two dozen. ii Proposed and seconded that Mr McGregor be requested to supply them at the lowest quotation. The chocolate colour later became claret. Nobody is quite sure why claret and blue became the club s adopted colours. Several other English football teams adopted their colours clubs that wear claret and blue include West Ham United and Burnley. Aston Villa s current home venue is Villa Park, which is a UEFA star rated stadium, having previously played at Aston Park and Wellington Road. Villa Park is the largest football stadium in the English Midlands, and the eighth largest stadium in England. It has hosted England internationals at senior level, the first in, and the most recent in. Thus, it was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi final history, having hosted semi finals. The club have planning permission to extend the North Stand this will involve the filling in of the corners to either side of the North Stand. If completed, the capacity of Villa Park will be increased to approximately,. It was announced on August, that Villa Park would appear in the FIFA video game from FIFA onwards, with all other Premier League stadiums also fully licensed from this game onwards. Aston Villa have a large fanbase and draw support from all over the Midlands and beyond, with supporters clubs all across the world. Former Villa chief executive Richard Fitzgerald has stated that the ethnicity of the supporters is currently white. When Randy Lerner s regime took over at Villa Park, they aimed to improve their support from ethnic minorities. A number of organisations have been set up to support the local community including Aston Pride. A Villa in the Community programme has also been set up to encourage support among young people in the region. The new owners have also initiated several surveys aimed at gaining the opinions of Villa fans and to involve them in the decision making process. Meetings also occur every three months where supporters are invited by ballot and are invited to ask questions to the Board. In, the club supported a supporter based initiative for an official anthem to boost the atmosphere at Villa Park. The song The Bells Are Ringing is to be played before games. Aston Villa s arch rivals are Birmingham City, with games between the two clubs known as the Second City Derby. Historically though, West Bromwich Albion have arguably been Villa s greatest rivals, a view highlighted in a fan survey, conducted in. The two teams contested three FA Cup finals in the late th century. Villa also enjoy less heated local rivalries with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Coventry City. Through the relegation of West Brom and Birmingham City, to the Football League Championship, in the season, at the start of Premiership season, Villa were the only Midlands club in that League. The nearest opposing team Villa faced during that season was Sheffield United, who played miles km away in South Yorkshire. For the season, West Bromwich Albion were promoted and joined Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Birmingham City in the Premier League. This marked the first time that the West Midlands Big Four clubs have been in the Premier League at the same time, and the first time together in the top flight since the season. Birmingham were relegated at the end of the season, ending this period. As of the end of the season, Aston Villa have spent seasons in the top tier of English football the only club to have spent longer in the top flight are Everton, with seasons, making Aston Villa versus Everton the most played fixture in English top flight football. Aston Villa were in an elite group of seven clubs that has played in every Premier League season, the other six being Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal since its establishment in until they were relegated in. They are seventh in the All time FA Premier League table, and have the fifth highest total of major honours won by an English club with wins. Aston Villa currently hold the record number of league goals scored by any team in the English top flight goals were scored in the season, one more than Arsenal who won the league that season for the very first time, with Villa runners up. Villa legend Archie Hunter became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa s victorious campaign. Villa s longest unbeaten home run in the FA Cup spanned years and games, from to. Aston Villa have won European and domestic league honours. The club s last major honour was in when they won the League Cup.

As of June As of June Pattycake was born on September, to western lowland gorilla parents Lulu and Kongo at the Central Park Zoo. Lulu and Kongo first arrived at the zoo on May,. At the time, it was thought that Lulu wasn t mature enough to conceive, so when Lulu gave birth to Pattycake at the age of, it came as a surprise. Up until the time Lulu gave birth, it had been very difficult to get captive gorilla mothers to raise their young in zoos because the babies would either be rejected by the mother or they would be taken away by the handlers. Pattycake was the first gorilla successfully born in captivity in New York. The news media would have liked to have it a dramatic bloody mess a struggle between mom and pop for the custody of the child. It was nothing like that. It was a simple accident. Kongo was in one part of the double cage, Lulu in another, and between them was a partition of narrow bars. Lulu had Patty Cake in her arms and when Patty reached in between the narrow bars to touch her father, Lulu suddenly pulled her away. But Patty s arm got caught in the narrow bars and broke. It was a freak accident. No one ever realized that those bars were narrow enough to catch that tiny arm. Pattycake s mother Lulu died in early. You re Gonna Love Tomorrow is the fifth season premiere episode of the American comedy drama series Desperate Housewives, and the th episode overall. It originally aired on September, in the United States on ABC American Broadcasting Company. The episode was written by series creator Marc Cherry and directed by Larry Shaw. You re Gonna Love Tomorrow, as well as all subsequent episodes, takes place five years after the events of the fourth season finale following Cherry s decision to revamp the series with a time jump. You re Gonna Love Tomorrow received mostly positive reviews from television critics, most of whom agreed that the time jump refreshed the show. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode drew over million viewers, making it the most watched show of the night and the second most watched program of the week across all networks. According to Nielsen ratings, You re Gonna Love Tomorrow was watched by. million viewers and held an. rating share on its original American broadcast on September,.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can t Believe It s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said it was a good Marge centric episode with plenty of clever set pieces the tributes to Cheers and Lost in Space are fantastic, and noted that Marge s father looks suspiciously like Moe. Ryan Keefer at DVD Verdict said that with the cast of Cheers appearing except for Grammer, ironically and a funny spoof of North by Northwest, the episode is much better than you would expect, and gave it a B. Innis laid the basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As the head of the University of Toronto s political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American trained professors unfamiliar with Canada s history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research. Innis attended the one room schoolhouse in Otterville and the community s high school. He travelled miles km by train to Woodstock, Ontario, to complete his secondary education at a Baptist run college. He intended to become a public school teacher and passed the entrance examinations for teacher training, but decided to take a year off to earn the money he would need to support himself at an Ontario teachers college. At age, therefore, he returned to the one room schoolhouse at Otterville to teach for one term until the local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher. The experience made him realize that the life of a teacher in a small, rural school was not for him. Innis s war was over. His biographer, John Watson, notes the physical wound took seven years to heal, but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime. Innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service. Watson also notes that the Great War influenced Innis s intellectual outlook. It strengthened his Canadian nationalism sharpened his opinion of what he thought were the destructive effects of technology, including the communications media that were used so effectively to sell the war and led him, for the first time, to doubt his Baptist faith. Everywhere Innis went his methods were the same he interviewed people connected with the production of staple products and listened to their stories. Harold Innis s interest in the relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study, The Fur Trade in Canada An Introduction to Canadian Economic History. The book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early th century to the s. Instead of focusing on the heroic European adventurers who explored the Canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done, Innis documents how the interplay of geography, technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and Canada s political and economic destiny. He concludes that the fur trade largely determined Canada s boundaries adding that the country emerged not in spite of geography but because of it. Unlike many historians who see Canadian history as beginning with the arrival of Europeans, Innis emphasizes the cultural and economic contributions of First Nations peoples. We have not yet realized, he writes, that the Indian and his culture was fundamental to the growth of Canadian institutions. Although Innis remains appreciated and respected for the grand and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have suggested that this style may have been a result of Innis illness late in his career. Innis s reputation as a public intellectual was growing steadily and, in, Premier Angus L. Macdonald invited him to serve on a Royal Commission to examine Nova Scotia s economic problems. The next year, he helped establish The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science. In, he was appointed a full University of Toronto professor and a year later, became the head of the university s Department of Political Economy. Innis maintained that scholars had no place in active politics and that instead, they should devote themselves, first to research on public problems, and then to the production of knowledge based on critical thought. He saw the university, with its emphasis on dialogue, open mindedness and skepticism, as an institution that could foster such thinking and research. The university could provide an environment, he wrote, as free as possible from the biases of the various institutions that form the state, so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives. In the s, Harold Innis reached the height of his influence in both academic circles and Canadian society. In, he helped establish the American based Economic History Association and its Journal of Economic History. He later became the association s second president. Innis played a central role in founding two important sources for the funding of academic research the Canadian Social Science Research Council and the Humanities Research Council of Canada. Innis s theories of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant he had a profound influence on critical media theory and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation. The most significantly affected area was Veracruz, where damage reached over billion pesos million USD. Most of it came from road damage in the state s northern portion, although there were also hundreds of damaged houses. Between Veracruz and neighboring Hidalgo, there were, people affected across municipalities. Overall there were six deaths in the country, one in Veracruz and five in Puebla. In the latter state, a family of three perished in a landslide. Upon developing, the depression was located in an area of weak steering currents, resulting in an erratic movement generally to the south. In its formative stages, the depression executed a small loop. As it did so, it moved into an area of very warm waters and decreasing wind shear. The depression s convection gradually organized, although the winds were slower to increase. An anticyclone became established over the system, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lorenzo at around UTC on September. At the time, it was located about mi km east of Tuxpan, Veracruz, moving steadily westward under the influence of a building ridge to its east. As it approached the coast, Lorenzo rapidly intensified unexpectedly, and within hours of attaining tropical storm status it strengthened into a hurricane. Overall, the hurricane affected, people across Veracruz and Hidalgo, prompting the declaration of a state of emergency in municipalities. The declaration allowed the usage of emergency resources for the affected people. There were a total of six deaths in the country, five of which in Puebla. By about three days after the storm, all schools were reopened. The Mexican government distributed food, water, and construction materials for the areas most affected in Veracruz. Following the storm, about power workers were dispatched in Veracruz to restore electricity in the affected areas. Cadmium is created via the long s process in low medium mass stars with masses of. to solar masses, taking thousands of years. In that process, a silver atom captures a neutron and then undergoes beta decay. The British Geological Survey reports that in, China was the top producer of cadmium with almost one sixth of the world s production, closely followed by South Korea and Japan. Cadmium is a common component of electric batteries, pigments, coatings, and electroplating. Cadmium is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors, acting as a very effective neutron poison to control neutron flux in nuclear fission. When cadmium rods are inserted in the core of a nuclear reactor, cadmium absorbs neutrons preventing them from creating additional fission events, thus controlling the amount of reactivity. The pressurized water reactor designed by Westinghouse Electric Company uses an alloy consisting of silver, indium, and cadmium. Cadmium can be used to block calcium channels in chicken neurons. Analytical methods for the determination of cadmium in biological samples have been reviewed. Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. An estimated of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. Absorption of cadmium through the lungs is more effective than through the gut, and as much as of the cadmium inhaled in cigarette smoke may be absorbed. On average, cadmium concentrations in the blood of smokers is times times greater and in the kidney, times greater than non smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from passive smoking. Using tactics first developed against the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War, the Australians gained the advantage of the high ground and assaulted the Chinese positions from unexpected directions. They then repelled repeated Chinese counterattacks aimed at re capturing Maryang San, with both sides suffering heavy casualties before the Australians were finally relieved by a British battalion. However, with the peace talks ongoing, these operations proved to be last actions in the war of manoeuvre, which had lasted the previous sixteen months. It was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences reminiscent of the Western Front in. A month later, the Chinese subsequently re captured Maryang San from the British during fierce fighting, and it was never re gained. Today, the battle is widely regarded as one of the Australian Army s greatest accomplishments during the war. Given the primary task of capturing Hill, Hassett studied the approaches from the air and the ground. Two previous attempts to take Maryang San by American troops had been unsuccessful. Regardless, utilising tactics first developed against the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War of running along the tops of ridges, he intended to gain the advantage of the high ground, while utilising the cover afforded by the vegetation and the ease of movement along the crest lines, in order to assault the Chinese positions from unexpected directions. Meanwhile, the Chinese defenders on Maryang San were also testing a newly developed tactic called the mobile positional defense, in which only small units were stationed on the hills in order to exhaust the UN attackers, while the bulk of the Chinese defenders would later counterattack before the UN forces could consolidate into their newly gained positions. At on October, B Company RAR moved north, metres, yd toward Hill, crossing the open valley under the cover of darkness and heavy mist. A Company then moved up behind C Company. Artillery and mortar fire targeted known Chinese artillery positions with counter battery fire prior to dawn, before switching to support the Borderers in their assault on Hill. Simultaneously, the Shropshires were assaulting Hill and with the support of A Squadron, th Royal Irish Hussars they reached the positions without opposition by. By B Company had gained the high ground to the north and then proceeded to patrol the short distance to west to the objective which was then taken with three wounded five Chinese were killed and one captured. By mid morning, both the Shropshires and the Australians had successfully captured their objectives. Given the strong resistance exhibited by the Chinese, the Canadians expected a tough fight as th Brigade prepared to assault its objectives as part of the second phase of the divisional plan. Yet with the loss of Hill and the Chinese unexpectedly withdrew from their well prepared defensive positions, with Hill and captured without opposition. Only the nd Battalion, Princess Patricia s Canadian Light Infantry encountered any opposition before they captured the two Hill features, losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which Chinese were also killed. Indeed, the ease with which the Canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on, attaining their final objectives on the Jamestown Line by nightfall. No further resistance was encountered, although heavy Chinese artillery fire caused a number of casualties, including three killed. The Canadians subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next twenty two months of fighting. Meanwhile, on the th Brigade s left flank the Shropshires met slight resistance, securing Hill southwest of Kowang San by. They were then relieved by the Canadians by nightfall in preparation for the third phase of the operation. The brigade plan was now a day behind schedule, although with the unexpected ease experienced by the Canadians, overall, the divisional attack was still running according to plan. However, determined to hold on following the loss of Hill, the Chinese moved in fresh troops, heavily reinforcing a number of positions, including Maryang San. Earlier that morning, at, B and D Companies RAR had moved north across the valley, while Anti Tank Platoon crossed the Imjin, taking up positions further north in order to protect the right flank. The assaulting companies would then move west towards a series of objectives before assaulting Hill. Initially RAR was to attack from the east, while RNF would attack from the southwest through Hill, however with the Fusiliers facing stiff resistance on Hill itself they were unable to get forward to assist. The previous attempts to capture Maryang San had failed due to the approach to steep eastern slopes of the feature being across a wide, open valley that was dominated by enfilade fire from mutually supporting Chinese positions. Consequently, the Australians planned to cross the valley under cover of darkness and position themselves on the Chinese flank in the foothills, before scaling the position at first light. A Company would create a diversion on the left flank, while B Company would clear the lower slopes before D Company passed through to assault the Chinese main defensive position, known as the Victor feature, in a one up, one in depth assault. However, following the casualties of previous nights on Hill, and, and the effect of constant shelling, RAR was now reduced to just men. In contrast, the Australians faced two fresh Chinese battalions on Maryang San, in total about, men. With both sides exhausted from the fighting the night of October was less eventful than expected, and the Australians used the opportunity to develop their position. To add further depth to their defences and to probe the Chinese positions, Taylor ordered the Australians to capture the central remaining Chinese position, the Sierra feature a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of Maryang San and the Hinge the next day. Meanwhile, the Fusiliers would renew their attack on Hill. The southern approach to Hill had proved to be too strongly defended by the Chinese and it became obvious that if it was to be overcome Taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders. To do this the high ground to the north west of Maryang San, known as the Hinge, would be vital. Indeed, adjacent to Hill, the Hinge dominated it from the north. As such for the next assault, planned for the morning, the Fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack the Hinge from the east, using the Australian positions on Maryang San as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on Hill. Four hours later, at, RAR was relieved on Maryang San and the Hinge by the Borderers, having lost killed and wounded. Chinese casualties on Hill had been severe, with at least killed determined by body count and another captured, while hundreds more were thought likely to have been killed and wounded. Later it was estimated that the Australians had destroyed at least two Chinese battalions during the five day battle. RNF once more advanced against Hill, this time without opposition, sending patrols to confirm that the Chinese had withdrawn. They were met by patrols from KOSB on the Hinge, with the Borderers taking control of the area at. Hill was latter occupied on October by the Borderers. The RAR Assault Pioneer Platoon, the Anti Tank Platoon and a platoon from C Company remained on Maryang San however, and during the evening of October the Pioneers killed four Chinese during a probe on their position. They were finally relieved on October. For his leadership, Hassett was immediately awarded the DSO, while a number of awards were also made to others that had distinguished themselves during the fighting. The Royal Australian Regiment was subsequently granted the battle honours Kowang San and Maryang San. Today, the First Battle of Maryang San is widely regarded as one of the Australian Army s greatest accomplishments of the Korean War. Indeed, the evacuation of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters on a number of occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition. Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor. Indeed, the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over, rounds in direct support of RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout. Tennyson completed the poem on October, but it was not published until, in his second collection of Poems. Unlike many of Tennyson s other important poems, Ulysses was not revised after its publication. Tennyson originally blocked out the poem in four paragraphs, broken before lines, and. In this structure, the first and third paragraphs are thematically parallel, but may be read as interior and exterior monologues, respectively. However, the poem is often printed with the first paragraph break omitted. Tennyson penned Ulysses after the death of his close Cambridge friend, the poet Arthur Henry Hallam, with whom Tennyson had a strong emotional bond. The two friends had spent much time discussing poetry and philosophy, writing verse, and travelling in southern France, the Pyrenees, and Germany. Tennyson considered Hallam destined for greatness, perhaps as a statesman. However, critics note that in the Homeric narrative, Ulysses original mariners are dead. A significant irony therefore develops from Ulysses speech to his sailors Come, my friends, Tis not too late to seek a newer world. Since Dante s Ulisse has already undertaken this voyage and recounts it in the Inferno, Ulysses entire monologue can be envisioned as his recollection while situated in Hell. The contemporary reviews of Ulysses were positive and found no irony in the poem. Author John Sterling like Tennyson a member of the Cambridge Apostles wrote in the Quarterly Review in, How superior is Ulysses, There is in this work a delightful epic tone, and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble. Tennyson s volume of poetry impressed Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle. Quoting three lines of Ulysses in an letter to Tennyson The album was begrudgingly released by Yankovic, who felt that the compilation was unnecessary and merely a way for his record label to make money. Several food related songs that Yankovic had recorded, such as Girls Just Want to Have Lunch and Waffle King were left off the record, although the former was due to personal preference, while the latter was due to scheduling issues. The Food Album received mixed reviews from music critics, many of whom felt that the record was an enjoyable collection of songs, but that it was not an essential record to purchase. Despite the lukewarm reception, the record was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA, making it Yankovic s first and only compilation record to reach this certification. Upon release, The Food Album failed to chart however, it sold steadily. On January, more than ten years after its release the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA. This makes it Yankovic s first and only compilation album to sell over, copies and be certified Gold. The Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God is not the first church building to occupy the position on top of the Tsarevets hill. It was constructed directly on top of a late Roman early Byzantine basilica which dates to the th th century AD. The Roman basilica may have remained in use by the local congregation during the First Bulgarian Empire, though it was no longer active by the time the construction of the current church began. Daydream is the fifth studio album by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, released on October, by Columbia Records. The follow up to her internationally successful album Music Box and holiday album Merry Christmas, Daydream differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards R B and hip hop. Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums. With Daydream, Carey took more control over the musical direction as well as the album s composition. Carey said she considered Daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation, a change that became more apparent in her sixth album Butterfly. During the album s production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label and husband Tommy Mottola. On Daydream, Carey collaborated with Jermaine Dupri for the first time, and co wrote and produced a song with Kenneth Babyface Edmonds, with whom she had collaborated on Music Box. It was also the first time she had worked with Boyz II Men, an R B group consisting of four male vocalists. Together, they wrote the concept and lyrics for One Sweet Day, a song that Carey co produced with Afanasieff. With his assistance and the addition of a few contemporary producers, she was able to make a subtle transition into the R B market. Daydream was nominated for six Grammy Awards at the th annual ceremony, during which Carey performed live. Due to the album s critical and commercial success, critics believed Carey would be one of the night s big winners. However, to her dismay, she was completely shut out, causing the subject to become very public and controversial. She left the annual ceremony empty handed. At the time of its release, Daydream became Carey s best reviewed album. Critics universally praised her matured lyrics and songwriting, as well as her musical direction. The album became an international success, debuting at number one in nine different countries, and in the top five in almost every major music market. Daydream became Carey s second album to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA, denoting shipments of ten million copies in the United States. Aside from its success in the United States, the album made the top five of the best selling albums in Japan by a non Asian artist, with. million copies sold. Daydream remains one of the best selling albums of all time, with million copies sold worldwide. While Carey s new musical direction caused tension between her and Columbia, it began to severely strain her relationship with her husband at the time, Tommy Mottola. Mottola had always been involved in Carey s career, because he was the head of Sony Music, the parent company of her label. Since the time of Carey s debut, Mottola had controlled nearly every aspect of her career, keeping her sound carefully regulated and insisting that she continue recording middle of the road pop music, despite her interest in hip hop. Daydream entered the Billboard at number one, with, copies sold, staying at the top spot the following week with, copies sold, for a third consecutive week, it topped the charts with, copies sold. It gained power again in the upcoming weeks of holiday sales where it peaked in the year s last weeks with, and, units sold at the pinnacle. The album moved, copies during the Christmas week of, the album s highest sales week. It also reached number one on Top R B Hip Hop Albums chart. Daydream was the second best selling album of, and the eighteenth best selling album on the s decade in the US. In the United States, Daydream became Carey s best selling album, being certified diamond by the RIAA RIAA, denoting shipments of ten million copies. In Australia, Daydream was certified five times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association ARIA, denoting shipments of, copies. The album finished ninth on the ARIA End of Year Charts in both and. In Japan, the album debuted at number one on the Oricon charts. According to the Oricon, Daydream made the top five of the best selling albums in Japan by a non Asian artist, with. million copies sold. Daydream remains one of the best selling albums of all time, with sales of million copies worldwide. Six singles were released from Daydream. Fantasy was released as the album s lead single on September,. The song debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot, making Carey the first female artist, and the second performer ever to accomplish the feat. The song spent eight consecutive weeks atop the chart, as well as topping the charts in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. In Europe, Fantasy performed well, peaking within the top five in Belgium, Finland, France, and the United Kingdom. Fantasy was the second best selling single of in the US, with sales of. million in alone. One Sweet Day was chosen as the follow up single, achieving similar success. The song once again debuted at the top of the US charts, and became the longest running number one single in US history, spending sixteen consecutive weeks atop the Billboard charts. The song became a success in other regions around the world as well, topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand and peaked within the top five in Australia, France, Ireland, and The Netherlands. Serving as the album s third single in select European countries, Open Arms was released on December,. The song achieved success in the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, where it peaked at number four, seven and eight. However, Open Arms charted weakly in other European countries, such as Belgium, France, and Germany, where it charted outside the top thirty. They did not expect me to get that shot, They were saying, How s she going to sing on a roller coaster,... We put a little speaker on the bottom of the car, where my feet where. We built the rig in front of the roller coaster and the lens kept falling off, When Carey and Boyz II Men got together to record One Sweet Day, they didn t have enough time to re unite and film a video. For this reason, a filming crew was present during the song s recording, and filmed bits of Carey and Boyz recording the song. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Walter Afanasieff made the following statements regarding the video for One Sweet Day It was crazy, They had film crews and video guys, while I m at the board trying to produce. And these guys were running around having a ball, because Mariah and them are laughing and screaming and they re being interviewed. And I m tapping people on the shoulder. We ve got to get to the microphone, They re gone in a couple of hours, so I recorded everything they did, praying that it was enough. Notes Track listing and credits from album booklet. Fantasy contains a sample of Genius of Love by Tom Tom Club. Leg before wicket lbw is one of the ways in which a batsman can be dismissed in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman s body except the hand holding the bat. The umpire s decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball. After considerable debate and various experiments, the law was changed again in. In an attempt to reduce pad play the new version, which is used to this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial. In his survey of cricket laws, Gerald Brodribb states No dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw it has caused trouble from its earliest days. Owing to its complexity, the law is widely misunderstood among the general public and has proven controversial among spectators, administrators and commentators lbw decisions have sometimes caused crowd trouble. Since the law s introduction, the proportion of lbw dismissals has risen steadily through the years. Statistics reveal that the probability of a batsman being dismissed lbw in a Test match varies depending on where the match is played and which teams are playing. According to MCC guidelines for umpires, factors to consider when giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for the height of the ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman. Teams that toured other countries often became frustrated by lbws given against them there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception have suggested that home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points out that it is impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.

The Peach Bowl was a post season American college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Hurricanes from the University of Miami at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia on January,. The game was the final contest of the NCAA Division I A football season for both teams, and ended in a victory for Miami. Another game by the same name followed the NCAA Division I A football season and was played in December,. Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the Peach Bowl as a reward for finishing during the regular season, a record that included wins over nationally ranked teams such as the Clemson Tigers and the Virginia Cavaliers. Facing Virginia Tech was a familiar post season opponent Miami whom the Hokies had played in the Liberty Bowl, Tech s last bowl appearance prior to the Peach Bowl. Miami finished the regular season with an record, including wins over Florida State and Florida. Miami got off to a good start doing just that as it raced out to four consecutive wins to begin the season, including a victory over nationally ranked rival No. Florida State. On October, however, Miami traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to face the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and suffered its first loss of the season to the undefeated Irish, who would go on to be ranked No. in the country. This defeat was followed in succession by two others, but the Hurricanes were able to stop the slide on November with a homecoming win over East Carolina. Miami added two more wins before the end of the season, and brought the regular season to a close with an overall record of. The Virginia Tech Hokies, like Miami, entered the season after accumulating a record in. Though the Hokies traveled far less than Miami, they also hoped to improve upon their losing record. Tech was coached by Bill Dooley, who was entering his third season as head coach. Miami s defense shut out one opponent, and held six other opponents to single touchdowns or field goals. Middle guard Jim Burt was one of the Hurricanes defensive leaders, recovering four fumbles in a single game during the regular season. In recognition of this and other performances, Burt was named to the Associated Press All America list. Also recognized was defensive back Fred Marion, who was named an honorable mention to the All America list. Marion intercepted seven passes during the regular season, tying him for second in Miami history for the most interceptions in a season. Throughout the regular season, Virginia Tech s offense was led by running back Cyrus Lawrence, who accumulated what was then a school record of, yards during the regular season. He also set a record for most carries by a Tech player in a season with. Tech quarterback Steve Casey was called the key man in the Tech offense. Casey was Tech s starting quarterback and completed of passes during the regular season for, yards and touchdowns. At the time, he ranked second among Tech s career passing leaders, and was considered to be an offensive threat. The Tech defense was ranked among the top five in the country during the regular season, and set a school record for fewest points allowed during an game regular season. Tech permitted just points during the season, and allowed only touchdowns in games. Virginia Tech s defense also featured Robert Brown, who accumulated tackles, including two quarterback sacks, in the Hokies regular season finale against the Virginia Military Institute. Tech head coach Bill Dooley lobbied in vain for Brown s inclusion in the annual All America list recording the best college football players in the country, saying, Robert Brown is an All American football player... but because he was a transfer student, he received no preseason buildup.... I guarantee the people who have seen him know he s an All American. Brown finished the regular season with tackles, broke up four passes, and recovered three fumbles. Miami began the second quarter in possession of the ball and facing a first down at the Virginia Tech yard line. From there, it took Miami just four plays to score. Roan ran for seven yards, Kelly completed an yard pass, threw an incomplete pass, then Hobbs ran yards for the touchdown. The score and following extra point gave Miami a lead with remaining before halftime. Because Miami received the ball to begin the game, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. After Miami s kickoff and a touchback, Tech began the first possession of the second half at its yard line. The Hokies picked up a quick first down off a rush each by Lawrence, Dovel, and Casey. Lawrence picked up another with two rushes that resulted in yards and drove the Hokies to their yard line. There, Casey completed his longest pass of the game a yard throw to tight end Rob Purdham that gave Tech a first down at the Miami yard line. Tech continued to drive, picking up short yardage with multiple rushes. The Hokies suffered a near disaster when Lawrence fumbled the ball, but Tech retained possession when the ball rolled out of bounds at the one yard line. Two plays after the fumble, Lawrence vaulted over the goal line for Tech s first and only touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech cut Miami s lead to with remaining in the quarter. Tech received Miami s kickoff for a touchback, and the Hokies offense began work at the Tech yard line. Lawrence ran for six yards, and time ran out in the quarter. With one quarter remaining, Miami held a lead. Tech began the fourth quarter in possession of the ball and facing a second down at its yard line. Despite needing just another four yards for a first down, Tech was unable to gain the needed yardage and was forced to punt. During the kick, Miami was penalized five yards, and began its first possession of the fourth quarter at its yard line after the penalty. Kelly completed an yard pass for a first down, but Miami was unable to gain another. After punting to Tech, the Hokies were likewise unable to gain a first down and went three and out after committing a delay of game penalty. Tech s punt was short, and Miami began a possession at the Tech yard line. The Hurricanes picked up a first down with two rushes by Roan for a total of yards. Despite further short gains by Roan, the Hurricanes were stopped short by the Tech defense and were unable to gain another. Miami sent in kicker Dan Miller, who kicked a yard field goal to give Miami a lead with remaining in the game. Virginia Tech running back Cyrus Lawrence finished the game with carries for rushing yards and a touchdown. The carries remain the most ever recorded by a single Virginia Tech player in a bowl game. Tech quarterback Steve Casey led the Hokies in passing yardage, completing nine of his pass attempts for yards and one interception. The Hurricanes ground offense was led by Smokey Roan, who carried the ball times for yards. Second to Roan for Miami was Chris Hobbs, who contributed yards and a touchdown on carries. Hurricanes wide receiver Larry Brodsky finished with four catches for yards and a touchdown. Miami turned the ball over four times during the course of the game. Tech s yard touchdown drive in the third quarter remains tied for the longest ever recorded by a Tech offense during a bowl game. Conversely, the yard drive allowed to Miami remains the longest scoring drive Tech s defense has ever allowed in a bowl game. On defense, Virginia Tech linebacker Ashley Lee s tackles remains the most ever recorded by a Tech defender in a bowl game. Three Tech players were tied for second on the team with eight tackles. Behind defensive MVP Burt, Miami had one player with eight tackles and two with seven. Fred Marion, one of the Hurricanes with seven tackles, also intercepted a Tech pass and broke up another pass. Although internationally successful in his lifetime, van der Weyden fell from view during the th century, and was not rediscovered until the early th century. The Magdalen Reading can first be traced to an sale. After passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the Netherlands, the panel was purchased by the National Gallery, London, in from a collector in Paris. It is described by art historian Lorne Campbell as one of the great masterpieces of th century art and among van der Weyden s most important early works. Michael Engler, the director of this episode, was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing Comedy Series. This episode also earned Carrie Fisher a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series and earned Jack Burditt a nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. Peaking at only number on the Billboard, Polka Party, was met with mixed reviews and was considered a commercial and critical failure. Despite this, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in. Polka Party, is one of Yankovic s few studio albums not to be certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA and was later demoted to a budget release in. Despite the album s lackluster reception, many of the songs on the album, such as Dog Eat Dog, Addicted to Spuds, and Christmas at Ground Zero, went on to become fan favorites and live staples. Two of the album s tracks, Living with a Hernia and Addicted to Spuds, appeared on Yankovic s first greatest hits album, Christmas at Ground Zero appeared on the second volume. In addition, the box set Permanent Record Al in the Box contained five of the album s songs Addicted to Spuds, Dog Eat Dog, Here s Johnny, Living with a Hernia, and Christmas at Ground Zero. Only Dog Eat Dog, however, appeared on Yankovic s Essential collection, although the. version contained Living with a Hernia. The following is adapted from the album liner notes. Trees is a lyric poem by American poet Joyce Kilmer. Written in February, it was first published in Poetry A Magazine of Verse that August and included in Kilmer s collection Trees and Other Poems. The poem, in twelve lines of rhyming couplets of iambic tetrameter verse, describes what Kilmer perceives as the inability of art created by humankind to replicate the beauty achieved by nature. The location for a specific tree as the possible inspiration for the poem has been claimed by several places and institutions connected to Kilmer s life among these are Rutgers University, the University of Notre Dame, and towns across the country that Kilmer visited. However, Kilmer s eldest son, Kenton, declares that the poem does not apply to any one tree that it could apply equally to any. Trees was written in an upstairs bedroom at the family s home in Mahwah, New Jersey that looked out down a hill, on our well wooded lawn. Ironically, Kenton Kilmer stated that while his father was widely known for his affection for trees, his affection was certainly not sentimental the most distinguished feature of Kilmer s property was a colossal woodpile outside his home. Kilmer s poetry was influenced by his strong religious faith and dedication to the natural beauty of the world. The abdomen is bronze to black with a white basal band and two white transverse bands. The transverse bands are often broken to form six spots. Some or all of these spots may be lacking, however. Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders are known to exhibit elaborate courtship displays. As a male approaches a female, it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and vibrate its abdomen. If the female is receptive, it will often vibrate its abdomen as well. The specific patterns of courtship behavior, however, vary between individuals. The Peach Bowl was a post season American college football bowl game at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the North Carolina State Wolfpack from on December,. The game was the final contest of the NCAA Division I A football season for both teams, and ended in a victory for Virginia Tech, the first bowl victory in school history. NC State, needing to score, drove down the field and kicked a go ahead yard field goal with remaining in the game. After a failed possession, Tech was forced to punt the ball, allowing NC State to run down the clock. The Virginia Tech defense eventually forced a stop, giving the Tech offense one final chance to win the game. With on the clock and beginning from their own yard line, the Hokies drove yards to the NC State yard line. There, kicker Chris Kinzer successfully kicked a yard field goal as time expired to give Virginia Tech the win. Virginia Tech had not participated in a bowl game since the Independence Bowl against Air Force, while NC State was playing in its first postseason game since. The two teams had played each other times prior to the Peach Bowl, with Virginia Tech leading the all time series,. Following Virginia Tech s kickoff, NC State returned the ball to the yard line, where the Wolfpack began the game s first play. That play was a short run to the right. On the next play, NC State picked up the game s first first down with a rush up the middle by fullback Mal Crite. Crite picked up another first down on the next play, driving the Wolfpack inside Virginia Tech territory, but the Hokies defense stiffened and forced the Wolfpack to punt after NC State failed to gain another first down. Tech returned the punt to its yard line, where the Tech offense took over. On Virginia Tech s first offensive play, running back Maurice Williams broke free for a yard run that took the Hokies inside the one yard line of NC State. The run was the longest of Williams career and is a Peach Bowl record for longest play from scrimmage. Two plays later, Virginia Tech s Eddie Hunter crossed the goal line and scored the game s first points. The touchdown and extra point made the score, Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech received NC State s kickoff and returned it to their yard line, where Tech s offense returned to the field. After picking up short yardage on two rushing plays, Tech quarterback Erik Chapman completed a pass to tight end Steve Johnson to give the Hokies a first down at their yard line with just over four minutes to go in the quarter. Tech continued to drive into Wolfpack territory, but inside the NC State yard line, Tech committed a yard illegal block penalty that pushed the Hokies back to the Wolfpack yard line and had them facing a first down and yards. Though unable to gain the yards needed for another first down, Tech did make up most of the penalty yards, putting the ball at the Wolfpack yard line. Facing fourth down, Tech sent in kicker Chris Kinzer to attempt a yard field goal, which was successfully completed. The score gave Tech a lead with remaining the first quarter. Kinzer delivered the post score kickoff, and NC State began its final drive of the first quarter at its yard line with remaining. The Wolfpack picked up a quick first down but were forced to punt when they did not gain another. NC State s punt was returned to the Tech yard line and the quarter came to an end with Virginia Tech leading,. Following the score, kickoff, and return, Tech began another offensive possession at its yard line. The Hokies picked up two first downs and drove into NC State territory, but the clock continued to tick toward halftime. In the Wolfpack side of the field, Tech running back Eddie Hunter broke free for a yard run, the longest play by Virginia Tech in the second quarter. There was now just over two minutes remaining in the quarter. Tech was unable to pick up another first down after Hunter s run, and attempted to convert the fourth down rather than trying a field goal. When the play was stopped for a loss, however, Virginia Tech was denied points and NC State s offense returned with seconds remaining in the half. The Wolfpack proceeded to run out the clock and took a lead into halftime. Because NC State received the ball to begin the game, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. Tech received NC State s kickoff and returned it to the yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Tech began working down the field, running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains. Tech picked up three first downs, then reached NC State territory on a pass to Donnelly. Once on the NC State side of the field, Tech picked up another first down, but Tech s quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away. The ball landed at the NC State yard line where the Wolfpack began a drive. NC State went three and out after receiving the ball, and after Tech incurred a running into the kicker penalty on the first punt attempt, NC State punted the ball away. After the kick, Tech took over on offense at its yard line. On Tech s first play after the punt, however, Hunter fumbled the ball after a yard rush. NC State recovered the ball, and the Wolfpack offense returned to the field at the Tech yard line. On their first play after the fumble recover, Kramer completed a yard pass to Worthen for a first down. During the next play, Kramer fumbled the ball while attempting to run with it, and Virginia Tech s defense recovered. This allowed the Tech offense to return to the field and attempt another offensive drive beginning at their yard line. Tech picked up a first down, then Chapman was forced to scramble for a first down after facing third and. Stopped inches short of gaining the first down, Tech risked turning the ball over by attempting to convert the fourth down. Unlike their previous try in the game, Tech was successful and the Hokies drive continued. Tech continued to pick up yardage and first downs, advancing deep into the NC State side of the field. Inside the State yard line, Tech quarterback Chapman was sacked for a yard loss. He responded by throwing a yard pass on the next play, driving Virginia Tech inside the State one yard line. Williams rushed into the end zone with seconds remaining in the quarter, cutting the Wolfpack lead to. Virginia Tech elected to attempt a two point conversion, which was unsuccessful. NC State received Tech s post touchdown kickoff and returned the ball to their yard line. The Wolfpack offense had time for just one play an eight yard pass before the end of the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, NC State still held a lead. The fourth quarter began with NC State in possession of the ball at their yard line and facing a second down and one yard. On the first play of the quarter, NC State quarterback Erik Kramer ran the ball, but fumbled at the end of the run. The ball was recovered by Virginia Tech, and the Hokie offense took the field. The first Virginia Tech play of the quarter was a first down throw to David Everett that drove the Hokies into Wolfpack territory. Tech followed the pass by driving down the field with alternating run and pass plays. Tech penetrated the NC State yard line with minutes remaining in the quarter, and continued to drive. Once the Hokies crossed the State yard line, the State defense stiffened and the Hokies were able to gain a first down only with difficulty. With a first down at the State seven yard line, it took Tech just two plays to earn a touchdown. The Hokies again attempted a two point conversion, but were again stopped short. Despite that setback, the touchdown gave Tech six points and a lead, their first since the mark in the second quarter. Following the post score kick, Tech began its offensive drive at its yard line with just under seven minutes to play in the game. The Hokies picked up a first down on three short rushing plays, then another on a single passing play. This drove the Hokies to their yard line with just over five minutes to play. Tech was unable to gain another first down and was forced to punt the ball to NC State. The ball was fielded at the yard line, which was where the NC State offense began its final drive of the game. In recognition of their performance in a losing effort, NC State quarterback Erik Kramer was named the game s offensive most valuable player, while on defense, NC State cornerback Derrick Taylor won the honor. Kramer finished the game having completed of his passes for yards. On the opposite side of the field, Virginia Tech quarterback Eric Chapman finished with completions out of attempts for two touchdowns and passing yards. Virginia Tech s win brought it to a final record of, while NC State s loss took it to a final record of. The victory was Virginia Tech s first bowl win in school history and was the team s only such win until, when Tech defeated Indiana University in the Independence Bowl. During its service, the tower began to tilt and the keepers moved all the furniture to one side of the tower. The problem was reported to have been exacerbated following the New England hurricane. This list includes known keepers, but excludes assistants and non officers of the Coast Guard. The Action of September was an inconclusive frigate engagement during the Napoleonic Wars between British Royal Navy and French Navy frigates during which a British frigate was defeated by two French vessels near Isle de France now Mauritius, but British reinforcements were able to recapture the ship before the French could secure her. The British frigate was HMS Africaine, a new arrival to the Indian Ocean. She was under the command of Captain Robert Corbet, who had served there the previous year. Corbet was a notoriously unpopular officer and his death in the battle provoked a storm of controversy in Britain over claims that Corbet had either committed suicide at the shame of losing his ship, been murdered by his disaffected crew, or been abandoned by his men, who were said to have refused to load their guns while he remained in command. Whether any of these rumours were accurate has never been satisfactorily determined, but the issue has been discussed in several prominent naval histories and was the subject of at least one lawsuit. The action was the first of two in this campaign in which lone British frigates were briefly overwhelmed by superior French forces as they sailed independently to join Rowley s squadron. On each occasion however, Rowley was able to recapture the lost frigate and drive off the French attackers. Corbet s action was particularly violent, British casualties totalling killed and wounded, including every single officer and all but three of the soldiers embarked. Africaine was seriously damaged and would not be ready to return to active service for some months. French losses were less severe, Astre suffering one killed and two wounded, Iphignie nine killed and wounded. South leg The entire highway was in Kent County.

Under the young King Edward VI John Dudley became one of the most powerful politicians, rising to be Earl of Warwick and later Duke of Northumberland. After the fall of Lord Protector Somerset in, John Dudley joined forces with his wife to promote his rehabilitation and a reconciliation between their families, which was symbolized by a marriage between their children. In the spring of Jane Dudley, Duchess of Northumberland became the mother in law of Lady Jane Grey, whom the Duke of Northumberland unsuccessfully tried to establish on the English throne after the death of Edward VI. Mary I being victorious, the Duchess sought frantically to save her husband s life. Notwithstanding his and her son Guildford s executions, she was successful in achieving the release of the rest of her family by befriending the Spanish noblemen who came to England with Philip of Spain.

The group toured the United States, Europe, and Australia, with bands including the Foo Fighters, Sonic Youth, and Guided by Voices. Critics commented on the loose and rough quality of these performances. The Amps continued as a group until, when Deal changed their name back to the Breeders. By, Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley had left the band they were all at times involved in various projects with Guided by Voices Robert Pollard. Deal s next album, the Breeders Title TK, was released seven years after Pacer.

Aside from taking the first close up pictures of the planet, the probes discovered its magnetosphere and its largely fluid interior. The Voyager and Voyager probes visited the planet in, and studied its moons and the ring system, discovering the volcanic activity of Io and the presence of water ice on the surface of Europa. Ulysses further studied Jupiter s magnetosphere in and then again in. The Cassini probe approached the planet in and took very detailed images of its atmosphere. The New Horizons spacecraft passed by Jupiter in and made improved measurements of its and its satellites parameters. The Galileo spacecraft was the first to have entered orbit around Jupiter, arriving in and studying the planet until. During this period Galileo gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the four large Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede. As it approached Jupiter, it also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker Levy. In December, it sent an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere, so far the only craft to do so. In July, the Juno spacecraft, launched in, completed its orbital insertion maneuver successfully, and is now in orbit around Jupiter and preparing for its science programme. A major problem in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land, as there is a smooth transition between the planet s atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter. The first spacecraft to explore Jupiter was Pioneer, which flew past the planet in December, followed by Pioneer twelve months later. Pioneer obtained the first ever close up images of Jupiter and its Galilean moons the spacecraft studied the planet s atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and determined that Jupiter is mainly fluid. Pioneer made its closest approach, within some, km of Jupiter s cloud tops, on December,. It obtained dramatic images of the Great Red Spot, made the first observation of Jupiter s immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter s moon Callisto. The information gathered by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet. In, the Cassini probe, en route to Saturn, flew by Jupiter and provided some of the highest resolution images ever taken of the planet. It made its closest approach on December, and made many scientific measurements. About, images of Jupiter were taken during the months long flyby. It produced the most detailed global color portrait of Jupiter yet, in which the smallest visible features are approximately km mi across. Major scientific results of the Galileo mission include the first observation of ammonia clouds in another planet s atmosphere the atmosphere creates ammonia ice particles from material coming up from lower depths confirmation of extensive volcanic activity on Io which is times greater than that found on Earth the heat and frequency of eruptions are reminiscent of early Earth observation of complex plasma interactions in Io s atmosphere which create immense electrical currents that couple to Jupiter s atmosphere providing evidence for supporting the theory that liquid oceans exist under Europa s icy surface first detection of a substantial magnetic field around a satellite Ganymede identification of the global structure and dynamics of a giant planet s magnetosphere. NASA launched Juno on August, to study Jupiter in detail from a polar orbit when it arrives in. The spacecraft will be placed in a polar orbit to study the planet s composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. Juno will also search for clues about how Jupiter formed, including whether the planet has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, and how the mass is distributed within the planet. Juno will also study Jupiter s deep winds, which can reach speeds of km h. Juno started orbiting Jupiter on the night of th July. While scientists require further evidence to determine the extent of a rocky core on Jupiter, its Galilean moons provide the potential opportunity for future human exploration. At this time Semaphore, with its jetty built in, was the state s main entry point for passengers and mail. It had a signal station built and a time ball tower built. Semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the s. When the decision was made to build the fort, in, the state s population had reached approximately,. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network. At this point Adelaide had a population of over,. Port Adelaide was the main port for South Australia, with over ships visiting each year, and a local population of over,. Construction began in and though completed by the fort was operational in. Changes were made to the design during construction. Some forced by armament changes and others made to ensure additional security, including a rear defence wall and connecting road from Military Road. By January two guns were in place and the fort opened later the same year with an extensive opening ceremony on October. In addition to parades, a small target was moored, yards, m offshore and fired on by all guns. A total of sixteen shots were fired during which one of the ten inch guns proved faulty. Only one ranging shot was fired and the shots were estimated to land from on target to yards short. The fort s final cost was approximately, A. million in consisting of, for physical structures and the remainder for armament and fittings. At the time of its construction it was at the forefront of such fortification design, and was considered state of the art. There is little in the way of surviving personnel records from the fort s active time. They may have either been destroyed or transferred to Melbourne after federation. The fort s record book shows it manned by a section of either the Royal Australian Artillery or B Company of the militia garrison artillery. For the time covered by the book, strength varied from to men of all ranks. Two figures who served at the fort are remembered for their impact outside its operation Battery Sergeant Major Charles Moritz, who initially joined the volunteer artillery and was the Permanent Artillery s first recruit. Joseph Maria Gordon, the fort s first commander and later military commandant for South Australia. Gordon retired in as Chief of the General Staff, Australian Military Forces. The entrance road was constructed from Military Road to the fort s rear gates. Its path is largely followed by the modern Queen Elizabeth II walk, though the former road was slightly to the south. This walk links the conservation park s visitor centre to the fort gates some of the old road can still be seen close to the gates. What was the muster ground is partly taken up by the caravan and camping park and a car park. It was levelled and filled in the s for this use. What remains of this ground, north of the caravan park, was returned to its s profile in funded by a Federal Government grant. In the th century, the muster ground was used for training of the Volunteer Military Force including artillery, who camped on the site. As designed the fort s rear was protected with a wooden palisade or stockade. In a masonry wall was added, greatly strengthening defence. Most of the stockade was reconstructed in the s some of the original wooden structure is visible in the fort s north. After numerous proposals the sand hills rear and north of the fort were removed in, improving the fort s land defence and allowing the pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area was used as a bivouac and exercise area for the colony s volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner s store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner s shed was damaged by fire in and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the st century. Both types of heavy guns used where the only ones of their specific series and type to come to Australia. Though they were never fired in anger, the battery is only feet m above mean sea level which would have limited the accuracy of the mark III depression rangefinders used. Prior to two inch mm breech loading guns had been imported for use in small boats. This use was rejected by military authorities and the guns sat unused. In the South Australian Defence Committee proposed that the guns be mounted at Fort Glanville, replacing the pounders whose siege carriages were then unfit for service. This proposal would have greatly extended the useful life of the fort, at little cost. The two military branches, army and navy, could not reach agreement and the proposal was abandoned by. The gun s eventual fate is unknown, though a gun found in the Port River later indicates they may have been dumped. Fort Glanville Conservation Park is one of South Australia s most important heritage sites. It is the premier site in the state, and possibly Australia, for showcasing colonial era defences and fortifications. The fort is listed on both the South Australian Heritage Register and the National Trust s classified list. It is considered significant, in national historical military terms, for its association with Jervois and Scratchley both leading British defence experts who influenced Australian defence thinking in the late th century. The fort was very well constructed with high quality materials facts that have been noted as contributing to its preservation. The fort is largely intact and in original condition and is, along with Bluff Battery in Hobart, the best preserved Jervois Scratchley designed fort in Australia. It is the only Australian colonial fort to still have all of its original armament, and the only to have a regular living history program. Its companion Fort Largs does survive but in greatly modified condition, converted for use as the South Australia Police academy. The fort retains its original armament armament that is both rare in Australia and worldwide. The royal prerogative is a body of customary authority, privilege, and immunity, recognised in the United Kingdom as the sole prerogative of the Sovereign and the source of many of the executive powers of the British government. Today the royal prerogative is available in the conduct of the government of the United Kingdom, including foreign affairs, defence, and national security. The monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these and other matters, but limited power, because the exercise of the prerogative is in the hands of the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials. In simple terms, the prerogative is used to govern the realm in the name of the Crown although the monarch has the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn, her role involves no exercise of discretion. Today, some prerogative powers are directly exercised by ministers without the approval of Parliament, including the powers of declaring war and of making peace, the issue of passports, and the granting of honours. Prerogative powers are exercised nominally by the monarch, but on the advice of the prime minister whom the monarch meets weekly and of the cabinet. Some key functions of the British government are still executed by virtue of the royal prerogative, but generally the usage of the prerogative has been diminishing as functions are progressively put on a statutory basis. Abolition of the royal prerogative is not on the immediate horizon, and recent movements to abolish the role of the monarchy and its royal prerogative in government have been unsuccessful. The Ministry of Justice undertook a review of executive Royal Prerogative powers in October. Former Labour MP and cabinet minister Tony Benn campaigned unsuccessfully for the abolition of the royal prerogative in the United Kingdom in the s, arguing that all governmental powers in effect exercised on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and require parliamentary approval. Later governments argued that such is the breadth of topics covered by the royal prerogative that requiring parliamentary approval in each instance where the prerogative is currently used would overwhelm parliamentary time and slow the enactment of legislation. As this study was initiated, the route for the proposed freeway was located between th and th streets with a western end in Hudsonville and an eastern end in Lowell Township. The consultants were asked to study a full freeway and a limited access boulevard design. One final option was a no build alternative under this option, existing roads would be upgraded but no new roads would be built. The City of Grand Rapids opposed the freeway while the suburbs and townships south and west of the city supported it. City officials were concerned about the impact to commercial and industrial business in Grand Rapids. Hudsonville s city manager favored the proposal as a benefit to local vegetable producers who shipped produce to Detroit or Cleveland. Other supporters, such as the Georgetown Township supervisor, were concerned that delays in starting the project could increase costs. State and local officials expected the freeway in January to cost between million equivalent to million in. The road was to be started no sooner than. A second citizens group, the South Belt Citizens Committee, was formed in July to gain additional public information on the project and supplement the work of the other groups, including the South Belt Local Advisory Board. BKI was fired as consultant on the project by MDOT on September,. The switch to a new consultant delayed further study because of the timetable to take bids and interview the candidates. In the interim, work was shifted to local and state planners until a new consultant could be retained in an effort to minimize the delays involved. These local projects were focused on updating the information and maps from BKI s study and refining the scope of the highway s corridor. Construction of the remaining phases between US and M and between I and US was started on April,. Area roads that crossed the path of the new freeway were closed to traffic with posted detours so that work could begin on the roadbed for the freeway. The last major project for the freeway was to replace bridge beams in the overpasses from westbound I to eastbound M. Design flaws were found in in the size of the beams in the bridges over eastbound I and the ramp from westbound M to westbound I. The replacement was originally supposed to close traffic along I over a weekend in, but kept a lane closed for a full week, backing up traffic on the Interstate for two miles. km completion of the work was delayed when human error caused a shortage of nuts and bolts. A year after the freeway opened, traffic volumes along parallel roads like th, th and th streets dropped. At the same time, roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic. Wilson Avenue experienced a increase and sections of Byron Center Avenue jumped in traffic levels a month after M opened. Property values in the townships surrounding the freeway increased.. by as a result of development attached to the freeway. Local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area, driving housing starts as residents flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life. In, the Metro Health Village, a commercial development centered around the Byron Center Avenue exit and the hospital opened. Described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant, the village features restaurants, shops, offices and a hotel. Metro Health relocated from Grand Rapids to the location in Wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location. Since opening, even though the freeway was officially named for Paul Henry, the original South Beltline name is still in use.

Co director Hill accompanied Wales during, filming him as he journeyed around the globe. Hill took a two person film crew and traveled to China, Indonesia, India, South Africa, Australia and Europe, interviewing editors and contributors. Hill is himself an editor of Wikipedia, starting an article about a graffiti artist. Gibson and Hill required expertise in the creative and funding aspects of film making and invited Scott Glosserman to join the venture. Glosserman s involvement with the film began during the Writers Guild of America strike. After Glosserman signed on, the breadth of the endeavor became larger. The film ended up taking an additional three years to finish after Glosserman joined the production. The film was screened at the Savannah Film Festival on November, at Savannah College of Art and Design s Trustees Theater. It was scheduled for a limited theatrical release in the United States on November,. In his review for the Savannah Film Festival, Carlos Serrano of District wrote that though the subject matter covered a lot of ground, it utilized an efficient presentation Sounds like a lot to put in to one movie, but the film manages to make good use of its minute running time. Serrano commented on the presentation of Jimmy Wales during the film, In the end, I came out of the theater thinking of him as a three dimensional figure, very much a man with passion but neither completely good or evil. To be honest, this is very important in a film like this and is a definite plus for the movie. Serrano recommended the documentary, and concluded, This is definitely a solid film.... This film is definitely worth a viewing. It s interesting, well made, and presents varied perspectives on Wikipedia that help the narrative stay interesting. Traffic on the Hope Highway is very low, with the highest traffic count being just over vehicles daily, at its intersection with the Seward Highway.

Following the Game Boy s overnight success, Super Mario Land sold over million copies more than that of Super Mario Bros.. Despite early success, the series, along with the overall rhythm game genre, suffered from poor sales starting in. Activision had stated in early that the series was on hiatus for, while a seventh main title in the series was under development this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product. Activision later shut down sales of the series downloadable content, although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought. In, Activision announced the first new title to the series in years, Guitar Hero Live, released in October. The title is considered a reboot of the series, with development being performed by FreeStyleGames, who had developed the DJ Hero games previously. Ahead of Activision s fourth quarter financial report in February, Activision disbanded its Guitar Hero business unit and announced that it would cease development of the planned Guitar Hero game. Activision cited continued declines in the music genre to explain its decision. The closure also affected the DJ Hero series, as Activision stated that there were no plans to publish a music game during. Activision s vice president Dan Winters later clarified that the company was just putting Guitar Hero on hiatus and that they were just not making a new game for next year, that s all. The popularity of the series increased dramatically with the release of Guitar Hero II for the PlayStation in. Featuring improved multiplayer gameplay, an improved note recognizing system, and songs, it became the fifth best selling video game of. The PlayStation version of the game was offered both separately and in a bundle with a cherry red Gibson SG guitar controller. Guitar Hero II was later released for the Xbox in April with an exclusive Gibson Explorer guitar controller and an additional songs, among other features. About million units of Guitar Hero II have sold on the PlayStation and Xbox. Guitar Hero, the fifth main entry in the series, was confirmed in December. It was released on September, and includes songs from different artists. The game includes new game modes and features, including its Party Mode, which gives players the ability to drop in and out and change difficulties in the middle of a song. Artists including Johnny Cash, Matt Bellamy, Carlos Santana, Kurt Cobain and Shirley Manson appear as playable characters in the game. Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the s for the PlayStation, which was released in July, was the final game developed by Harmonix for the series. Though it was produced after Harmonix were purchased by MTV Games, it was part of their contractual obligation to complete the game. The game, as suggested by its name, features tracks primarily from the s. Another new title to the series, Band Hero, was announced in May. Band Hero features Top hits aimed at family audiences, and include the full band play style of Guitar Hero. The game was developed for the Nintendo DS, using the Guitar Hero On Tour Guitar Grip, a new drum skin to fit the DS Lite, and the DS s microphone to support the full band experience. Musician Taylor Swift appears as a playable character in the game, as do the members of No Doubt. Guitar Hero World Tour introduced drums and vocal tracks in addition to lead and bass guitar. Drum tracks are played similar to guitar tracks the player must strike the appropriate drum head or step down on the bass drum pedal on the controller when the note gems pass the indicated line. Certain note gems, when using a drum controller that is velocity sensitive, are armored, requiring the player to hit the indicated drum pad harder to score more points. Vocal tracks are played similar to games such as Karaoke Revolution where the player must match the pitch and the pacing of the lyrics to score points. Guitar Hero allows players to create a band of up to four players using any combination of instruments. The series has also been criticized for its release model in contrast to the Rock Band series, causing some players to hold contempt towards Activision. Harmonix considered the Rock Band series as a music platform, and supported it with downloadable content and the ability to import songs from its games and expansions into most other games of the series. Critics argued that Guitar Hero should have been doing the same, either through releasing expansions that could be incorporated into the main games of the series, or by issuing the songs as downloadable content. The release of Guitar Hero Smash Hits, reworking older songs from the series to full four instrument band support but otherwise adding no additional material, was called the definition of milking by reviewers, with no observable technical limitation as to why the songs could not be added as downloadable content. Ars Technica recognized that licensing issues might have limited when songs from one single game could be played in others of the series such as the case for The Beatles Rock Band, but that such cross compatibility should have been a high priority for rhythm games. Furthermore, some expansions were praised for the additional content beyond the note matching gameplay Guitar Hero Metallica is considered to be one of the series best works to be developed by Neversoft in part due to the care that the developers took with imaging the band and the available extras for the game. Activision later revealed that both Guitar Hero and Band Hero would support playing songs from both Guitar Hero World Tour both on disc and downloadable content and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, with music licensing being the only limiting factor on which songs could be made forward compatible. All games are published by Activision, except the first Guitar Hero and the PS version of Guitar Hero II, which were published by RedOctane.

The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn. Migration southwards from the breeding range starts in October but the bulk of birds arrive in the United Kingdom in November. Some of these are still on passage and carry on into continental Europe but others remain. The passage migrants return in April and they and the resident migrants depart from the United Kingdom mostly by early May. In the United Kingdom, at the extreme edge of the fieldfare s breeding range, only a handful of pairs breed. It is therefore classified by the RSPB as a Red List species as of January. Jifna has local traditions and legends relating to the Holy Family, and to the village water spring.

The census by the PCBS listed Jifna s population as, of which were males and females. Ottoman tax records from the late th century reveal that Jifna had a Christian population at the time also. An informal survey in found inhabitants, of whom were Catholics and the remainder reportedly Christians of other denominations. Palestinian Christians make up about of the residents, while the remaining are Muslims, mostly refugees. Unlike some other West Bank localities, unemployment is a minor issue in Jifna. However, the average income is low because of the unstable political situation in the Palestinian territories, Israeli checkpoints, the West Bank barrier and the freezing by Israel of funds to the Palestinian territories although the latter no longer applies to the West Bank. There are a number of local traditions in Jifna. A prominent legend among Jifna s inhabitants is that the Holy Family rested near an oak tree in the town on their way from Jerusalem.

In March, Lawton joined Second Division side Brentford for a club record, fee. Manager Jackie Gibbons left the club at the start of the season and was succeeded by his assistant Jimmy Bain, who proved ill suited to management, and so in January Lawton was appointed as player manager, with Bain as his assistant. However he lost the dressing room due to his excessive demands of the players, and the strains of management were having a negative impact on his form. Brentford also lost their best players having sold both Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill. He signed two veterans in former Notts County teammate Frank Broome and Ian McPherson to play on the wings, who, with Lawton, formed an attacking trio with a combined age of. They got off to a poor start to the season, and Lawton resigned as manager after the Griffin Park crowd began to mock the forward line by singing Dear Old Pals. More than years of soccer. What glorious years. Years that all the money in the world couldn t buy. I have been lucky. I have played with great clubs I have escaped serious injury I have played for my country I have even captained my country I have won many of the game s top honours. Soccer has been good to me and I hope that I have repaid the game in some small way. I have had great experiences. I have met some wonderful people. I have memories that nobody can take away from me. If I could turn the clock back years, I would still go into the game as a full time professional and I can say to any lad who is contemplating a career in football Go ahead son... providing you are willing to work and work hard and providing you are willing to learn the craft thoroughly. You will meet some of the grandest fellows you could ever wish to meet and you will have a pleasant, healthy life and be quite well paid for it.

He was naturally right footed, though worked to improve his left foot to a good enough standard to be considered a two footed player. His greatest strength though was his ability to head the ball, as he possessed muscular legs to give himself a strong jump and long hang time, and was also able to time his jumps to perfection. Stanley Matthews surmised that Quite simply, Tommy was the greatest header of the ball I ever saw. Lawton was never booked throughout his career.

When Tintin in the Congo was first released by the series Scandinavian publishers in, they objected to page, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Herg to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Herg agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big game hunting in the work soon after producing it.

The album amounted to Stevens greatest public success to date it was his first to place on the Billboard, and it topped the Billboard list of Heatseekers Albums. The varied instrumentation and experimental songwriting on the album invoked comparisons to work by Steve Reich, Neil Young, and The Cure. Besides numerous references to Illinois history, geography, and attractions, Stevens continued a theme of his songwriting career by including multiple references to his Christian faith. The creation of Illinois marked a shift in Stevens emphasis on songwriting and studio work toward live performance and more abstract concepts of motion and sound subsequent tours and albums emphasized electronic music and modern dance over the indie folk material on Michigan and Illinois. He has ceased writing songs about individual characters with straightforward narratives or concept albums and briefly considered quitting the music business entirely after creating and promoting this album.

As a Christian, he has written and recorded music about spiritual themes throughout his career particularly on the album Seven Swans and prefers to talk about religious topics through song rather than directly in interviews or public statements. The song Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Stepmother, includes the line It s the great I Am taken from the response God gave when Moses asked for his name in the Book of Exodus Exodus. Casimir Pulaski Day describes the death of a girlfriend due to bone cancer, and the narrator questions God in the process. More abstract allusions appear in The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts, which utilizes Superman as a Christ figure and The Seer s Tower, which references the Book of Revelation and the Second Coming of Christ. Songs which were not written with an explicit theological focus such as John Wayne Gacy, Jr. also feature religious themes such as sin and redemption.

Super Science Stories was an initial success, and within a year Popular increased Pohl s budget slightly, allowing him to pay a bonus rate on occasion. Pohl wrote many stories himself, to fill the magazine and to augment his salary. He managed to obtain stories by writers who subsequently became very well known, such as Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. After Pohl entered the army in early, wartime paper shortages led Popular to cease publication of Super Science Stories. The final issue of the first run was dated May of that year. In the title was revived with Ejler Jakobsson as editor this version, which included many reprinted stories, lasted almost three years, with the last issue dated August. A Canadian reprint edition of the first run included material from both Super Science Stories and Astonishing Stories it was unusual in that it printed some original fiction rather than just reprints. There were also Canadian and British reprint editions of the second incarnation of the magazine.

This pattern continued for ten issues. The next issue, dated April, contained several reprints from the US editions, but also included two original stories that had not appeared anywhere before these had been acquired for the US magazine and remained in inventory. A total of eleven of these original stories appeared in the Canadian Super Science Stories. Later issues of the magazine also saw many reprints from Famous Fantastic Mysteries in tacit acknowledgement of the new source of material, the title was changed to Super Science and Fantastic Stories from the December issue. The artwork was mostly taken from Popular s US magazines but some new art appeared, probably by Canadian artists. There was no other Canadian presence the letters page, for example, contained letters from the US edition. In, when the second run of the US Super Science Stories began, another Canadian edition appeared, but this was identical in content to the US version. Two British reprint editions of the second run also appeared, starting in October. The first was published by Thorpe Porter the issues, which were not dated or numbered, appeared in October and February and June. The contents were drawn from the US issues dated January, November, and January respectively each was pages and was priced at. The second reprint edition was published by Pemberton s these were pages and again were undated and were priced at. The British issues are abridged versions of US issues from both the first and second series. The titles corresponded to the titles on the US magazine from which the stories were taken, so all were titled Super Science Stories except for the April issue, which was titled Super Science Novels Magazine.

Within the City of Kawartha Lakes, the road is now known as Kawartha Lakes Road, while within the County of Peterborough, it is known as Peterborough County Road. Within Bobcaygeon, Highway crosses the Trent Severn Waterway and intersects the eastern end of Kawartha Lakes Road. At this point it is following the southernmost section of the Bobcaygeon Colonization Road. At the intersection with Main Street in the northern end of the village, the route turns northeast while former Highway continues north. Highway remained essentially unchanged between and, with the exception of a being rerouted east of Lindsay in. However, on January, the entirety of Highway was downloaded to Victoria County and Peterborough County, both of which redesignated it as County Road. Victoria County became the City of Kawartha Lakes in, and that section of the route is now known as City Road. The following table lists the major junctions along Highway, as noted by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In addition, it includes some minor junctions. SR existed as a route to reach the north rim of the Grand Canyon National Park as early as as a dirt road. By, the road had been improved to a gravel road, and by it had been paved.

The designation included SR in its entirety as well as extending south into Grand Canyon National Park. Two years later, ADOT obtained the right of way for improvement of the highway from its northern terminus approximately miles km south. In, an additional right of way was acquired by ADOT from its southern terminus approximately miles. km north. By June of that year, the parkway received the designation of a National Forest Scenic Byway, and in June, the Kaibab Plateau North Rim Parkway received another designation, this time as a National Scenic Byway.

Oldham became the world s manufacturing centre for cotton spinning in the second half of the th century. In, over of Oldham s population was employed within the textile sector, compared to across Great Britain. It overtook the major urban centres of Manchester and Bolton as the result of a mill building boom in the s and s, a period during which Oldham became the most productive cotton spinning town in the world. In, Oldham had more spindles than any country in the world except the United States, and in, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. By there were. million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of million in the United Kingdom and. million in the world in, with the construction of the UK s largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith. At its peak, there were more than mills, operating night and day Oldham s built environment is characterised by its th century red brick terraced houses, the infrastructure that was built to support these and the town s former cotton mills which mark the town s skyline. The urban structure of Oldham is irregular when compared to most towns in England, its form restricted in places by its hilly upland terrain. There are irregularly constructed residential dwellings and streets clustered loosely around a central business district in the town centre, which is the local centre of commerce. In, Angus Reach of Inverness said Although Oldham had a thriving economy during the th century, the local merchants were broadly reluctant to spend on civic institutions, and so the town lacks the grandeur seen in comparable nearby towns like Bolton or Huddersfield public expenditure was seen as an overhead that undermined the competitiveness of the town. Subsequently, Oldham s architecture has been described as mediocre. The town has no listed buildings with a Grade I rating. A large portion of Oldham s residences are low value Victorian era Accrington red brick terraced houses in a row formation, built for the most part from to, to house the town s cotton mill workers. There is more modern housing in the semi rural east of the town, in the most sought after area in areas such as the village Moorside, although terraces are found in almost all parts of Oldham. Today, Oldham has large communities with heritage from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and parts of the Caribbean. At the time of the census, over one in four of its residents identified themselves as from a South Asian or British Asian ethnic group.

The geography of Oldham constrained the development of major transport infrastructure, with the former County Borough Council suggesting that if it had not grown substantially before the railway age it would surely have been overlooked. Oldham has never been on a main line railway route, and canals too have only been able to serve it from a distance, meaning that Oldham has never had a train service worthy of a town of its size.

The club was denied promotion to the Football Conference, however, as the Crabble Athletic Ground did not meet the standard required for that league. After finishing fourth and second in the subsequent two seasons, Dover won the title again in the season and this time were admitted to the Conference. Although Dover finished in eighth place in their first season in the Conference, the following season saw the club struggling against relegation, and Kinnear was dismissed due to a combination of the team s poor performances and his own personal problems. John Ryan was appointed as the club s new manager, but his reign was a short one and he was dismissed when the club lost seven of its first eight matches in the season. The club then appointed former England international Peter Taylor as manager, but he was unable to steer the team away from the foot of the table, and Dover held onto their place in the Conference only because Northern Premier League runners up Boston United failed to submit their application for promotion before the required deadline. In the club s early days Athletic struggled to attract crowds of over, but by the time the club reached the Conference, crowds at Crabble were averaging around,. After the club s relegation to the Isthmian League Division One South, the average attendance fell to just over, but when the club returned to the Premier Division for the season, the average attendance at Crabble was, the highest in the division. The highest home attendance in the club s history was, for the match against Crystal Palace in the third round of the FA Cup on January. Although Athletic s improved monetary position means that the Supporters Trust is no longer required to financially support the club, it remains active as a fundraising organisation.

There is a wide range of popular plum cakes and puddings. Since the meaning of the word plum has changed over time, many items referred to as plum cakes and popular in England since at least the eighteenth century have now become known as fruitcake. The English variety of plum cake also exists on the European mainland, but may vary in ingredients and consistency. Settlers in British colonies brought the dried fruit variety of cake with them, so that for example, in India it was served around the time of the Christmas holiday season and in the American colonies, where it became associated with elections, one version came to be called election cake. The English variety of plum cake also exists on the European mainland, although plum cake there more usually refers to baked cakes made with fresh, rather than dried fruit. Plum cake in the United States originated with the English settlers and was prepared in the English style in sizes ranging from small, such as for parties in celebration of Twelfth Night and Christmas, to large, such as for weddings. This original fruitcake version of plum cake in the United States has been referred to as a reigning standard American celebration cake through the time of the civil war. The song received positive reviews from critics, and has garnered awards. The single stayed on top of the Billboard Hot for six weeks, making it the third most successful single from the album after Yeah, and Burn, respectively. It was also ranked as the th biggest song of the decade in the US. The song is written from the perspectives of Keys and Usher, who play the role of an ex couple.

For Keys, The song is talking about the first person you ever really had feelings for. Even though you move on and meet new people, you always remember that first person. Usher recorded My Boo aside from Keys with various female artists. He collaborated with fellow R B singer Brandy Norwood and Usher recorded their own version as well, which appeared on her fourth album Afrodisiac. Brandy changed some of the lyrics, singing like having a conversation. However, neither of the two was included in the album. A remix of My Boo was also produced, featuring guest vocals from Nelly however, Keys part was omitted.

The route went for. miles. km along Port Street and Doremus Avenue through the industrial districts of the city. Route began at an intersection with U.S. Route and near Newark Liberty International Airport. The route crossed over the New Jersey Turnpike along Port Street until an intersection with Doremus Avenue, where it turned northward for the rest of the distance, terminating at an intersection with U.S. Route and Truck. Route began at an intersection with U.S. Route and in the area of Newark Liberty International Airport in the city of Newark. The route progressed eastward along Port Street, a divided highway for a short distance. The route crossed the access road to the airport before crossing over the newly constructed New Jersey Turnpike south of Interchange. From there, Route continued as Port Street but as one roadway into the industrial districts in Newark. The route progressed further over a railroad before intersecting with Doremus Avenue, where Route turned northward off of Port Street. Both Port Street and Doremus Avenue dead end right after this respective intersection, Doremus Avenue to the south and Port Street to the east. The entire route was in Newark, Essex County. Giacomo Meyerbeer born Jacob Liebmann Beer September May was a German opera composer of Jewish birth who has been described as perhaps the most successful stage composer of the nineteenth century. With his opera Robert le diable and its successors, he gave the genre of grand opera decisive character. Meyerbeer s grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition. These were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eugne Scribe and were enhanced by the up to date theatre technology of the Paris Opra. They set a standard which helped to maintain Paris as the opera capital of the nineteenth century. Born to a very wealthy Berlin family, Meyerbeer began his musical career as a pianist but soon decided to devote himself to opera, spending several years in Italy studying and composing. His opera Il crociato in Egitto was the first to bring him Europe wide reputation, but it was Robert le diable which raised his status to great celebrity. His public career, lasting from then until his death, during which he remained a dominating figure in the world of opera, was summarized by his contemporary Hector Berlioz, who claimed that he has not only the luck to be talented, but the talent to be lucky. He was at his peak with his operas Les Huguenots and Le prophte his last opera L Africaine was performed posthumously. His operas made him the most frequently performed composer at the world s leading opera houses in the nineteenth century. Apart from around songs, Meyerbeer wrote little except for the stage. The critical assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led to a decline in the popularity of his works his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century. Meyerbeer s works are only infrequently performed today. Thus as Wagner s stock rose, Meyerbeer s fell. In, the year before the Paris premiere of Wagner s Lohengrin, there were no Wagner performances at the Paris Opra, and performances of Meyerbeer s four grand operas. In, there were Wagner performances, and only three of Meyerbeer Les Huguenots being the sole work performed. Meyerbeer s costly operas, requiring grand casts of leading singers, were gradually dropped from the repertoire in the early th century. They were banned in Germany from, and subsequently in subject countries, by the Nazi regime because the composer was Jewish, and this was a major factor in their further disappearance from the repertory. Most importantly the operas themselves are now beginning to be revived and recorded, although despite the efforts of such champions as Dame Joan Sutherland, who took part in performances of, and recorded, Les Huguenots, they have yet to achieve anything like the huge popular following they attracted during their creator s lifetime. Recordings are now available of all the operas from Il crociato onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for Struensee. A Meyerbeer discography updated whenever an additional opera by Meyerbeer is issued on CD at the Wayback Machine archived October, State Route SR is a. mile. km long state highway located entirely within Benton County, Washington, United States. The highway serves to connect the unincorporated community of Paterson to the county seat Prosser. The highway has existed since at least and was designated as Primary State Highway E from until the renumbering of Washington state highways. Washington State Route SR starts at an intersection with SR in the unincorporated community of Paterson. After leaving Paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two lane highway. A few minor roads are intersected before the roadway turns to the west after about mi km, before turning back to the north. After the highway resumes its northerly course it climbs into the Horse Heaven Hills, gaining a passing lane through the uphill segments, before finally terminating at SR in south Prosser. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic AADT, which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In, WSDOT calculated that as few as, cars traveled through the central part of the highway, and as many as, cars at the interchange with SR. The roadway on its current alignment has existed since at least, however there are records of a road between Paterson and Prosser since. The highway was designated Secondary State Highway E SSH E in, but the route number was changed to SR during the state highway renumbering. High winds have forced the closure of SR in, and due to large amounts of dust being blown around, causing visibility to drop to almost zero through the Horse Heaven Hills. The entire highway is within unincorporated Benton County. The roller coaster originally featured two vehicles, each with three rows of four seats and one row of three seats for a total of riders per vehicle. Both vehicles were built to only run forward. After the ride was refurbished in, new streamlined vehicles with the Superman logo were introduced. The new vehicles were designed with low profile sides to enhance the open air feeling. Although they are wider, the row of the three seats in the older vehicle was reduced to two, resulting in a lower total of riders per vehicle. Both of the new trains were configured to run backward, though they were designed to run forward as well. It was reported that the park would eventually run one side forward to give riders a choice, but both trains have remained facing backward. General Fraser, alerted to the American withdrawal early on July, immediately set out in pursuit, leaving a message for General John Burgoyne to send reinforcements as quickly as possible. That night Fraser camped a few miles short of Hubbardton, and the German General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, leading reinforcements, camped a few miles further back. Rising early in the morning, Fraser reached Hubbardton, where he surprised some elements of the American rear, while other elements managed to form defensive lines. In spirited battle, the Americans were driven back, but had almost succeeded in turning Fraser s left flank when Riedesel and his German reinforcements arrived, eventually scattering the American forces. The battle took a large enough toll on the British forces that they did not further pursue the main American army. The many American prisoners were sent to Ticonderoga while most of the British troops made their way to Skenesboro to rejoin Burgoyne s army. Most of the scattered American remnants made their way to rejoin St. Clair s army on its way toward the Hudson River. American general St. Clair paused at Hubbardton to give the main army s tired and hungry troops time to rest while he hoped the rear guard would arrive. When it did not arrive in time, he left Colonel Seth Warner and the Green Mountain Boys behind, along with the nd New Hampshire Regiment under Colonel Nathan Hale, at Hubbardton to wait for the rear while the main army marched on to Castleton. When Francis and Hale s men arrived, Warner decided, against St. Clair s orders, that they would spend the night there, rather than marching on to Castleton. Warner, who had experience in rear guard actions while serving in the invasion of Quebec, arranged the camps in a defensive position on Monument Hill, and set patrols to guard the road to Ticonderoga. Livingston and Dunn, the two men sent toward the battle by St. Clair, were met by retreating Americans on the Castleton road after the battle was over. They returned to Castleton with the bad news, and the army marched off, eventually reaching the American camp at Fort Edward on July. According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus was declared king of Palmyra as soon as the news of the Roman defeat at Edessa reached the city. It is not known if Odaenathus contacted Fulvius Macrianus and there is no evidence that he took orders from him. The elimination of the usurpers left Odaenathus as the most powerful leader in the Roman east he was granted many titles by the emperor but those honors are debated among scholars According to David Potter, Vaballathus inherited his father s exact titles. Hartmann points that there have been cases where a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same thing. The dedication to Odaenathus would be the using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would be the direct translation. Despite all the arguments, it cannot be certain without doubt that Odaenathus was a corrector. In general, Odaenathus actions were connected to his and Palmyra s interests only his support of Gallienus and his Roman titles did not hide the Palmyrene base of his power and the local origin of his armies, as with his decision not to wait for the emperor to help in. Odaenathus status seems to have been, as Watson put it, something between powerful subject, independent vassal king and rival emperor. Odaenathus was assassinated along with Hairan I in late the date is debated and some scholars propose or, but Vaballathus dated his first year of reign between August and August, making late the most probable date. The assassination took place either in Anatolia, or in Syria while the king was returning to Palmyra there is no consensus on the manner, perpetrator or the motive behind the act. The Augustan History claims that a cousin of the king named Maeonius killed him, while the Anonymus post Dionem names the assassin as another Odaenathus. The number of children Odaenathus had with his first wife is unknown and only one is attested The children of Odaenathus and Zenobia are Vaballathus he is attested on several coins, inscriptions, and in the ancient literature.

Recording Mixed at Larrabee Studios, Universal City, CA Personnel It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them, in particular because it is a late Medieval church of exceptionally simple character, and is virtually unaltered despite its poor condition. One writer has said that St Mary s has the distinction of probably being the most isolated church in Anglesey. St Mary s is a small church, measuring feet by feet inches about. by. m. It dates from the late medieval period, and was constructed using rubble masonry and large stones. It had a slate roof, although most of the roof has now gone, and there is a bellcote at the west end, which may be original rather than a later addition. There is no physical division between the nave and the chancel, although one account in the th century said that there had originally been a screen separating them, and some traces of it still remained at that time. Entrance to the church was through a doorway with a square head, in the north wall at the west end this dates from the th century. An inscribed stone near the doorway has the date and some initials, and it has been suggested that this marked the date of some renovation work. There are two windows on the south wall, one fully blocked and one partially blocked. The small window at the east end of the church dates from the latter part of the th century. First Light is a young adult science fiction and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, first published in. The novel follows Peter, who is in Greenland with his father and mother for research on global warming, and Thea, who lives in Gracehope, an underground colony located below Greenland. First Light explains how global warming is melting Gracehope and Peter and Thea s attempt to persuade the people to leave. The novel addresses the effects of global warming as a theme. Stead drew inspiration from many sources in order to create the novel. As a child growing up in a big city, she was interested in the small towns which made her think that in smaller places, everybody, even the kids, had special identities, where as in a city people are pretty anonymous. An idea began to form for a hidden society that also served as a small town. After the revisions were completed, much of the plot stayed the same, but several events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book. Stead combined two characters into one, having a stronger outline and also cut out several scenes for minor characters. In the end, Stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive. The cathedral was constructed over a period of over two centuries, between and. Its design is a mixture of three architectural styles that predominated during the colonial period, Renaissance, Baroque and Neo classic. All the high reliefs of the portals of the cathedral were inspired by the work of Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens. This altar was damaged by fire in January but has been completely restored. This altar has been under restoration since. The Herrera door opens into the sacristy, the oldest part of the cathedral. It is a mixture of Renaissance and Gothic styles. In, The wooden floor and platform around the perimeter of the Sacristy were replaced with stone. The cathedral s sixteen chapels were each assigned to a religious guild, and each is dedicated to a saint. Each of the two side naves contain seven chapels. The other two were created later on the eastern and western sides of the cathedral. These last two are not open to the public. The fourteen chapels in the east and west naves are listed below. The first seven are in the east nave, listed from north to south, and the last seven are in the west nave. The Chapel of Saint Isidore Spanish Capilla de San Isidro was originally built as an annex between and, and was once used as the baptistery. Its vault contains plaster casts representing Faith, Hope, Charity, and Justice, considered to be basic values in the Catholic religion. After the Tabernacle was built, it was converted into a chapel and its door was reworked in a churrigueresque style. The cathedral contains other crypts and niches where other religious figures are buried, including in the chapels. The sinking ground and seismic activity of the area have had an effect on the cathedral s construction and current appearance. Forty two years were required simply to lay its foundation when it was first built, because even then the Spaniards recognized the danger of constructing such a huge monument in soft soil. However, for political reasons, much, but not all, of the cathedral was built over the remains of pre Hispanic structures, leading to uneven foundation from the beginning. Major restoration and foundation work began in the s to stabilize the building. Engineers excavated under the cathedral between and. They dug shafts under the cathedral and placed shafts of concrete into the soft ground to give the edifice a more solid base to rest on. These efforts have not stopped the sinking of the complex, but they have corrected the tilting towers and ensured that the cathedral will sink uniformly. USS Illinois BB was a pre dreadnought battleship built for the United States Navy. She was the lead ship of the Illinois class, and was the second ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for the st state. Her keel was laid in February at the Newport News Shipbuilding Dry Dock Company, and she was launched in October. She was commissioned in September. The ship was armed with a main battery of four inch mm guns and she had a top speed of knots km h mph. She was armed with a main battery of four in mm caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of fourteen in mm caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen pounder guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and six pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Illinois carried four in mm torpedo tubes in deck mounted launchers. Upon publication, The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic received predominantly positive reviews in academic peer reviewed journals such as Folklore and The Antiquaries Journal. In ensuing years, the book has been widely cited by scholars as an influential and pioneering text in the study of the archaeology of ritual and magic. By, Braathens SAFE s routes were so regular that several countries stated that a bilateral agreement would have to be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen year concession on February Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL s concession by granting Braathens SAFE a concession, but at the same time he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL s concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System SAS, were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on February, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger Amsterdam Geneva Rome Cairo Basra Karachi Bombay Calcutta Bangkok Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service announced on October that the two companies would merge from January. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi would be paid with NOK million in Helikopter Service shares. The Norwegian Competition Authority stated they would have to look at the merger, since the new company would have an almost monopoly on offshore flights. However, the ministry stated that the authority could not hinder the merger, because by the time new contracts were awarded in, helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid. The ownership of Braathens Helikopter was transferred to Helikopter Service on December. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi received of the shares in the merged company. They were immediately sold, giving Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi a NOK million profit on the five year venture. Gerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office. Gerard continued to oppose Anselm s attempts to assert Canterbury s primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard s death. Perfect Dark was under development for nearly a year and its game engine was completely re written from scratch to support several Xbox features. Therefore, although the game plays exactly the same as the original, the code and renderer is different. The game received generally favorable reviews. Some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be outdated, but most agreed that the title was a solid revival of a classic. As of the end of, the game had sold nearly, units. The plan of attack was for the British raiding force to sink two obsolete cruisers in the canal mouth at Ostend and three at Zeebrugge, thus preventing raiding ships leaving Bruges. The Ostend canal was the smaller and narrower of the two channels giving access to Bruges and so was considered a secondary target behind the Zeebrugge Raid. Consequently, fewer resources were provided to the force assaulting Ostend. While the attack at Zeebrugge garnered some limited success, the assault on Ostend was a complete failure. The German marines who defended the port had taken careful preparations and drove the British assault ships astray, forcing the abortion of the operation at the final stage. To block Bruges, Keyes and Lynes decided to conduct two raids on the ports through which Bruges had access to the sea. Zeebrugge was to be attacked by a large force consisting of three blockships and numerous supporting warships. Ostend was faced by a similar but smaller force under immediate command of Lynes. The plan was for two obsolete cruisers HMS Sirius and Brilliant to be expended in blocking the canal which emptied at Ostend. These ships would be stripped to essential fittings and their lower holds and ballast filled with rubble and concrete. This would make them ideal barriers to access if sunk in the correct channel at the correct angle. Lord Clive class monitors with in mm guns Destroyers Light craft torpedo boats, French motor launches HMS Sirius, Brilliant Destroyers Light craft Artillery support was also provided by Royal Marine heavy artillery in Allied held Flanders. The force was covered in the English Channel by seven light cruisers and destroyers, none of which saw action.

After peaking, Dot slightly weakened, but maintained its Category status for more than two days during that time it boasted an unusually large eye spanning as much as mi km in diameter. Late on August, a fourth reconnaissance flight into the storm found surface winds of mph km h, but this reading was discounted on the basis that pressures were unusually high for a storm of that intensity. On August, Dot passed mi km south of Ka Lae before the storm curved sharply towards the northwest late that day. A more definite weakening phase began after this point, and during the night of August, Dot made landfall on Kauai with winds estimated at mph km h, making the storm a Category equivalent at the time of landfall. After traversing the island, Dot was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and curved back to the west before eventually dissipating on August. Jacob Anthony deGrom born June, is an American professional baseball pitcher for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball MLB. Prior to playing professionally, deGrom attended Stetson University and played college baseball for the Stetson Hatters. DeGrom began playing baseball as a shortstop and was converted into a pitcher during his junior year at Stetson. The Mets selected him in the ninth round of the MLB Draft, and he made his MLB debut with the Mets on May,. That year, deGrom was named the National League s NL Rookie of the Month twice, and the NL Rookie of the Year. In, deGrom was selected as an MLB All Star. When deGrom returned to Stetson that fall, the team used him as a relief pitcher, filling the role of their closer, in addition to playing shortstop. He quickly became one of Stetson s best pitchers, so the team moved deGrom into their starting rotation midway through the season. In addition to a fastball, deGrom learned to throw a changeup and a slider. MLB scouts began to take notice of deGrom when he pitched against Chris Sale of Florida Gulf Coast University. In that game, deGrom hit his only home run of the season. He made starts for the Hatters, pitching to a win loss record with a. earned run average. The Mets added deGrom to their man roster on November, to protect him from being eligible in the Rule draft. During the offseason, deGrom improved his mechanics, and learned to throw a curveball. He began the season with Las Vegas, and had a win loss record and a. ERA in his first seven games started. Following the season, deGrom received a Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award as the best defensive player statistically at his position in Major League Baseball. The Battle of Merville Gun Battery occurred on June, as part of Operation Tonga, part of the Normandy landings, during the Second World War. Allied intelligence believed the Merville Gun Battery was composed of heavy calibre guns that could threaten the British landings at Sword Beach, only miles km away. When the British paratroopers had withdrawn, two of the guns were put back into action by the Germans. Another attack the next day by British Commandos failed to recapture the battery, which remained under German control until August, when the German Army started to withdraw from the area. In England, one of the gliders never left the ground, as its tow rope had snapped on taxiing. The other two gliders, unable to locate the battery, did not land where expected. On their run in, both gliders were hit by anti aircraft fire. One landed around miles. km away, the other at the edge of the minefield. The troops from this glider became involved in a fire fight with German troops heading to reinforce the battery garrison. On June, the battery was assaulted again by two troops of commandos from No. Commando, part of the st Special Service Brigade. The attack in daylight was repulsed with heavy losses to the commandos. As they withdrew, they were engaged by the battery s guns firing over open sights. The British never succeeded in completely destroying the battery, and it remained under German control until August, when the German Army started to withdraw from France. The church is still in use as part of the Church in Wales, one of four churches in a combined parish. It is a Grade II listed building, a designation given to buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them, in particular because it is regarded as a mid th century rural church, consistently articulated and detailed in an Early English style. The churchyard has seven gravestones that were discovered in the walls of the previous church. Six of them date from between the th and th centuries, and the seventh is from the th or th century. The doorway from the old church, dating from the th century, has been reused as an entrance to the churchyard. A carved stone human head, from the th century, has been inserted into the north wall of the churchyard. A war memorial in the shape of a Celtic cross remembers those who died during the First and Second World Wars. The church is a Grade II listed building the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them. It was given this status on January and Cadw the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales states that it has been listed because it is a mid th century rural church, consistently articulated and detailed in an Early English style.

The inclusive use of the term Wicca referring to the entirety of Pagan Witchcraft religion has been traced to Britain in the early s, when it was used by various groups and publicised through use in adverts, magazines, and other literary sources. It was later adopted by figures like Alex Sanders and Gavin and Yvonne Frost, who took it to the United States. There, practitioners of British Traditional Wicca adopted it exclusively for themselves as a means to differentiate their practices from those of other Pagan Witches. This exclusive meaning was countered by its popularisation as a generic term by prolific authors such as Raymond Buckland, Scott Cunningham and Silver RavenWolf. As it entered popular culture, it gained an increasingly eclectic character in its usage. During the s, some attempted to distance themselves from it by utilising the term Traditional Witchcraft.

There were great catch phrases and driving pulse rhythms... but the songs weren t serious or didn t reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings. By the time of Dylan s second album, The Freewheelin Bob Dylan, in May, he had begun to make his name as a singer and a songwriter. Many songs on this album were labeled protest songs, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger s passion for topical songs. Oxford Town, for example, was an account of James Meredith s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi. Mixed Up Confusion, recorded during the Freewheelin sessions with a backing band, was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound. Cameron Crowe described it as a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and Sun Records. In support of the album, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts with Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew and Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm, former members of Ronnie Hawkins s backing band the Hawks. On August at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan s electric sound. The band s reception on September at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable. Years ago they... said I was a prophet. I used to say, No I m not a prophet they say Yes you are, you re a prophet. I said, No it s not me. They used to say You sure are a prophet. They used to convince me I was a prophet. Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer. They say, Bob Dylan s no prophet. They just can t handle it. The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering folk and blues numbers Good as I Been to You and World Gone Wrong, featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song Lone Pilgrim, written by a th century teacher. In November Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on hits. The album from it, MTV Unplugged, included John Brown, an unreleased song of how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment. Dylan commenced the new millennium by winning the Polar Music Prize in May and his first Oscar his song Things Have Changed, written for the film Wonder Boys, won an Academy Award in March. The Oscar, by some reports a facsimile, tours with him, presiding over shows perched atop an amplifier. On October, Dylan released a Christmas album, Christmas in the Heart, comprising such Christmas standards as Little Drummer Boy, Winter Wonderland and Here Comes Santa Claus. Dylan s royalties from the sale of this album will benefit the charities Feeding America in the USA, Crisis in the UK, and the World Food Programme. In an interview published in The Big Issue, journalist Bill Flanagan asked Dylan why he had performed the songs in a straightforward style, and Dylan responded There wasn t any other way to play it. These songs are part of my life, just like folk songs. You have to play them straight too. On August, Columbia Records released Volume of Dylan s Bootleg Series, Another Self Portrait. The album contained previously unreleased tracks, including alternate takes and demos from Dylan s recording sessions during the making of the Self Portrait and New Morning albums. The box set also included a live recording of Dylan s performance with the Band at the Isle of Wight Festival in. Another Self Portrait received favorable reviews, earning a score of on the critical aggregator, Metacritic, indicating universal acclaim. AllMusic critic Thom Jurek wrote, For fans, this is more than a curiosity, it s an indispensable addition to the catalog. On October, IBM launched a marketing campaign for its Watson computer system which featured Dylan. Dylan is seen conversing with the computer which says it has read all his lyrics and reports My analysis shows that your major themes are that time passes and love fades. Dylan replies That sounds about right. On November, Sony Music released The Bootleg Series Vol. The Cutting Edge. This work consists of previously unreleased material from the three albums Dylan recorded Between January and March Bringing It All Back Home, Highway Revisited and Blonde on Blonde. The records have been released in three formats a CD Best Of version, a CD Deluxe edition, and an CD Collector s Edition in a limited edition of, units. On Dylan s website the Collector s Edition was described as containing every single note recorded by Bob Dylan in the studio in. The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded Cutting Edge a score of, indicating universal acclaim. The Best of the Cutting Edge entered the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart at number one on November, based on its first week sales. Dylan s performances in China in April generated controversy. Some criticised him for not making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan s performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan s art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan s set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for the names of the songs that I would be playing. There s no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play. Since, Dylan has published six books of paintings and drawings. In a interview with Bill Flanagan promoting Dylan s Christmas LP, Christmas in the Heart, Flanagan commented on the heroic performance Dylan gave of O Little Town of Bethlehem and that he delivered the song like a true believer. Dylan replied Well, I am a true believer. Dylan s lyrics began to receive detailed scrutiny from academics and poets. Literary critic Christopher Ricks published a page analysis of Dylan s work, placing him in the context of Eliot, Keats and Tennyson, claiming that Dylan was a poet worthy of the same close analysis. Former British poet laureate Sir Andrew Motion argued that his lyrics should be studied in schools. Since, academics have lobbied the Swedish Academy to award Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Shakespeare Quiney died at six months of age, and neither Richard nor Thomas lived past. The death of Judith s last child led to legal wrangling over William Shakespeare s will that lasted until. Scholars speculate that Thomas Quiney may have died in or when the burial records are incomplete. Quiney was a vintner and dealt in tobacco. He held the lease to a house known as Atwood s for the purpose of running a tavern, and later traded houses with his brother in law, William Chandler, for the larger house known as The Cage where he set up his vintner s shop in the upper half. He is recorded as selling wine to the corporation of Stratford upon Avon as late as. Shakespeare Quiney died at six months of age. Richard and Thomas Quiney were buried within a month of each other they were and years old, respectively. The deaths of all of Judith s children brought on new legal consequences. The entail on her father s inheritance led Susanna, along with her daughter and son in law, to make a settlement, by use of a rather elaborate legal device, for the inheritance of her own branch of the family. Legal wrangling continued for another thirteen years, until. Of Thomas Quiney s fate the records show little. It is speculated that he may have died in or when the parish burial records are incomplete. He certainly had a nephew in London, who by this time held the lease to The Cage. A transit of Venus across the Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes directly between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against and hence obscuring a small portion of the solar disk. During a transit, Venus can be seen from Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually measured in hours the transit of lasted hours and minutes. A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth. Venus transits are historically of great scientific importance as they were used to gain the first realistic estimates of the size of the Solar System. Observations of the transit, combined with the principle of parallax, provided an estimate of the distance between the Sun and the Earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time. The transit provided scientists with a number of other research opportunities, particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets. Venus, with an orbit inclined by. relative to the Earth s, usually appears to pass under or over the Sun at inferior conjunction. A transit occurs when Venus reaches conjunction with the Sun at or near one of its nodes the longitude where Venus passes through the Earth s orbital plane the ecliptic and appears to pass directly across the Sun. Although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only., Venus can be as far as. from the Sun when viewed from the Earth at inferior conjunction. Since the angular diameter of the Sun is about half a degree, Venus may appear to pass above or below the Sun by more than solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction. In, Johannes Kepler became the first person to predict a transit of Venus, by predicting the event. His methods were not sufficiently accurate to predict that the transit would not be visible in most of Europe, and as a consequence, nobody was able to use his prediction to observe the phenomenon. In, using the combined and transit data, the French astronomer Jrme Lalande calculated the astronomical unit to have a value of million kilometers million km. The precision was less than had been hoped for because of the black drop effect, but still a considerable improvement on Horrocks calculations. The transit provided scientists numerous research opportunities as well, in particular in regard to the study of exoplanets. Research of the Venus transit includes Measuring dips in a star s brightness caused by a known planet transiting the Sun will help astronomers find exoplanets. Unlike the Venus transit, the transit occurred during an active phase of the year activity cycle of the Sun, and it is likely to give astronomers practice in picking up a planet s signal around a spotty variable star. Observation made of the atmosphere of Venus simultaneously from Earth based telescopes and from the Venus Express gives scientists a better opportunity to understand the intermediate level of Venus atmosphere than is possible from either viewpoint alone. This will provide new information about the climate of the planet. The Hubble Space Telescope, which cannot be pointed directly at the Sun, used the Moon as a mirror to study the light that had passed through the atmosphere of Venus in order to determine its composition. This will help to show whether a similar technique could be used to study exoplanets. Tessa Nol is a fictional character in the television series Highlander The Series, portrayed by Alexandra Vandernoot. A mortal artist and sculptor, Tessa is the French lover of the protagonist Immortal, Duncan MacLeod, played by Adrian Paul. Tessa is introduced in the pilot episode The Gathering, first shown in, and appears in all subsequent episodes until The Darkness, the fourth episode of season two, in which she is killed. Vandernoot returned to the program for a number of guest appearances in the season two finale, Counterfeit, broadcast in, and the two part series conclusion To Be Not To Be. Tessa is MacLeod s mortal companion and bears the consequences of his immortality. These include her aging while he does not, the impossibility of having children together and the dangers of MacLeod s involvement in the Game, an ongoing battle in which all Immortals must behead each other until a single victor remains. Fully aware of this situation, Tessa stays with MacLeod, demonstrating her courage, understanding, generosity and compassion. Tessa Nol is a central character, who appeared in every episode of the first season of Highlander The Series, and in the first four episodes of the second. After the character s death, she later returned for cameo appearances in the episodes Counterfeit Part Two in the second season, and To Be and Not To Be, the sixth season s final two episodes. To Be and Not To Be, the series finale, respectively depict MacLeod dreaming of a world in which he was never born. Vandernoot reprises her role as Tessa, this time never having met MacLeod. Tessa leads an unsatisfactory life in which she has a husband and children, but is forced to sacrifice her art and sculpture. In this storyline she has an affair with MacLeod but feels she has betrayed her husband. Tessa, and Kirsch s character Richie, were designed as MacLeod s mortal companions and contacts. Tessa and MacLeod are lovers and share deep feelings for each other. Adrian Paul commented that MacLeod spent twelve years with Tessa without wanting another relationship and that... she was a very important part of his life. Vandernoot thought that... the relationship between Tessa and MacLeod was very deep because very soon, he told her about himself... because he trusted her, and I think trust is a very good definition of their relationship. She trusted him entirely and he trusted her. Tessa is thus MacLeod s only mortal lover who knows of his immortality. Vandernoot recalled, I think I was quite close to Tessa, she was very well written, very easy to play and I wish I was like that. I m not sure I d like that but... it s very nice, you know, to play a character with nice feelings and nice emotions. Vandernoot had to adapt to the North American way of filming series and learn to work fast. She said that filming the series was... exhausting but formative, and that filming in English was challenging. Vandernoot, who is a native French speaker, had a dialect coach. During the filming of the episode, however, no dialog was recorded. The final version of the episode shown in North America did not show Richie revive. The European version showed Richie reviving, but no dialog was present. This scene was later re recorded in Paris in during the filming of the season finale Counterfeit Part Two, this time including the dialog. However, this footage was not seen in the final version the footage was eventually used in the season four episode Leader of the Pack. Tessa remained extremely popular with the audience after her death, prompting the producers to develop the season two finale episode Counterfeit to bring her back. According to Kirsch, Vandernoot did not realize her, or her character s, popularity before attending conventions. Paul said that Vandernoot was surprised that her character had so much influence on the show and that her return was... fun for her to do, especially to play a different character which was similar to Tessa but also had an evil intent to her. The Counterfeit story features the character Lisa undergoing plastic surgery to become Tessa s double. Lisa was played by Meilani Paul before the surgery and by Vandernoot after it. The producers wondered whether the story needed to explain the change in Lisa s voice, as she would be played by a different actor. They considered suggesting that her voice changed because of the surgery, then decided that Lisa would have voice training. After her operation, Lisa speaks with Vandernoot s voice when posing as Tessa, and with Meilani Paul s voice when the character was not acting. This was achieved using automated dialogue replacement during post production. In, the Michigan State Legislature established the Lansing and Howell Plank Road Company, which set about converting various Indian trails into the Lansing Howell Plank Road, a task the company completed by. At Howell the road connected with the Detroit Howell Plank Road, establishing the first improved connection direct from the state capital to Michigan s largest metropolis. The Lansing Detroit Plank Road was a toll road until the s. It eventually evolved into the eastern part of the modern Grand River Avenue. All exits are unnumbered.

Thomas Mervyn Tom ap Rhys Pryce October January was a year old British lawyer who was robbed and murdered by two black teenagers as he made his way home in Kensal Green, northwest London, on January. The two, Donnel Carty and Delano Brown, showed little or no remorse and were sentenced to life imprisonment. The crime gained national notoriety for the particularly brutal way in which Pryce was murdered, only metres from his own home, and had only his Oyster card and mobile phone taken from him, but no money the case being widely reported as an example of steaming. The murderers were later tracked down when the police examined CCTV footage of where the Oyster card was used after the murder. The crime caused a political uproar and condemnation of railway station security. The Tom ap Rhys Pryce Memorial Trust was set up after the murder, and a school was built in his honour. Police caught Carty through CCTV footage which showed him using Pryce s Oyster Card which he claimed to have found at Kensal Green station, forensic evidence found at the homes of Carty and Brown, and Pryce s mobile phone. Carty and Brown both denied murder but admitted that they had robbed Pryce and another man just before. Brown was at the time of the offence so initially could not be named for legal reasons. The then Prime Minister Tony Blair s immediate response to the murder was to pledge the investigation of public safety at the station close to where Pryce was murdered, Kensal Green Station, and this was later improved. David Cameron criticised the Labour Government s criminal justice system and the absence of father figures in ethnic minority cultures, which he claimed as causes in the murder of Pryce. Cameron stated that lack of strong deterrent sentences for knife crimes and the failure of police to stop prolific criminals had played a role in the killing of Pryce. He insisted that parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.

Federer and Djokovic have met times with Djokovic leading wins. They are tied on hard courts and on clay while Djokovic leads on grass. The Federer Djokovic rivalry is the largest rivalry in men s Grand Slam tournament history with a record matches played against each other with Djokovic leading. Djokovic is the only player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in consecutive Grand Slam tournaments US Open and Australian Open, also Wimbledon, US Open and Australian Open, and the only player besides Nadal and Murray who has double figure career wins over Federer. Djokovic is one of two players the other again being Nadal currently on tour to have defeated Federer in straight sets at a Grand Slam event Australian Open, Australian Open, French Open and the only player to do so three times. Of their meetings, have reached a deciding set. Federer and Andy Murray have met times with Federer leading. Federer leads on hard courts, and on grass. They have never met on clay. The two have met six times at the Grand Slam tournament level, the first three times in the finals, Federer winning all three of these matches at the US Open and the Australian Open, both of which he won in straight sets, and at the Wimbledon Championships in which Murray took the opening set, but went on to lose in four sets. However, Murray won their encounter in the semifinals of the Australian Open, defeating the Swiss for the first time at a Grand slam tournament in five sets. At the Australian Open, Federer reversed that result, defeating Murray in four sets in the quarterfinals. The most recent meeting between the two in a Major was in the semifinals of the Wimbledon Championships, where a dominant Federer triumphed in straight sets. They met in the final of the Summer Olympic Games, in which Murray defeated Federer in straight sets, denying the Swiss a career Golden Slam. Murray also leads in ATP tournaments, in finals. They have also met five times at the ATP World Tour Finals, with Murray winning in Shanghai in, and Federer in London in,, and. Murray is one of only three players to have recorded or more victories over Federer the other two being Nadal and Novak Djokovic. One of Federer s longstanding rivalries was with American Andy Roddick. Roddick lost his world No. ranking to Federer after Federer won his first Australian Open in. Federer and Roddick met on occasions, including four Grand Slam event finals three at Wimbledon and one at the US Open all won by Federer. Federer s record is overall. Roddick himself said it was not much of a rivalry, being so one sided. In the Wimbledon final, Roddick lost to Federer in five sets. The match included a fifth set of games a Grand Slam final record and was over four hours long. In the final game of the deciding set, Roddick s serve was broken for the first time in the match. With that victory, Federer broke Pete Sampras record of Grand Slam tournament titles, and Roddick apologized to Sampras who was there for not being able to hold Federer. Marat Safin and Federer played each other times, with Federer leading. Federer and Safin turned pro within one year of each other, with Safin turning pro in and Federer in. Federer leads on hard courts, on grass, and on clay courts, while Safin leads on carpet. Notable meetings include Federer s defeating Safin at the Hamburg Masters to win the first Masters title of his career, as well as Federer s emerging victorious in the semifinals of the Tennis Masters Cup, after winning a tiebreak on his eighth match point. Federer also defeated Safin in the finals of the Australian Open to capture his first Australian Open and second Grand Slam tournament title. However, Safin defeated Federer in the Australian Open semifinals, having saved one match point in the fourth set tiebreak, to end a match winning streak by Federer. They met each other five times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading. David Nalbandian was Federer s biggest rival in his early career. The two played each other times, with Federer leading. Nalbandian dominated early on, taking all of their first five matches from. Federer reversed this trend at the Masters Cup, where he recorded his first victory, and would go on to win of their last meetings. Federer led on hard courts, on grass, and on clay courts, while Nalbandian led on carpet. Notable meetings include Nalbandian s win in a fifth set tiebreaker to win the Masters Cup, and Federer s win in the French Open semifinals. They met each other six times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading. Federer s versatility has been summarised by Jimmy Connors In an era of specialists, you re either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist... or you re Roger Federer. These records were attained in the Open Era of tennis. Records in italics are currently active streaks. Roger Federer at the International Tennis Federation Roger Federer at the Davis Cup Roger Federer at the Internet Movie Database Jane s Attack Squadron was first conceived by Looking Glass employee Seamus Blackley as Flight Combat, a combat based sequel to Flight Unlimited. The company continued designing the game after Blackley was fired in, and it entered production under Electronic Arts in. The team experienced problems with deadlines and funding during development, with the game eventually being heavily redesigned and renamed Jane s Attack Squadron at the request of the publisher. These issues contributed to Looking Glass s bankruptcy and closure in. In and, the game was acquired and finished by Mad Doc Software, a company in part composed of former Looking Glass employees. Each plane in Jane s Attack Squadron is composed of forty five parts that may be removed or otherwise damaged in combat. Damage to these parts affects performance for example, a broken fuel line will leak, quickly decreasing the fuel gauge. Various adjustments may be made to the game s realism, including an arcade physics option that drastically reduces flight difficulty. The game is packaged with the mission and physics editors that were used to develop it. Tropical Storm Brenda developed in the north central Gulf of Mexico at UTC on July. During the next hours, the storm strengthened rapidly and attained its maximum sustain wind speed of mph km h early on August although it is possible it briefly reached hurricane intensity. Later that day, Brenda made landfall east of New Orleans, Louisiana at the same intensity. The storm steadily weakened inland and by August, it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Early on August, Brenda dissipated while located over eastern Texas. A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression east of Cape Verde on August. After six hours, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Connie. By August, Connie began to rapidly strengthen, becoming the first major hurricane of the season later that day. Initially, it posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, although it passed about miles km north. The outer rainbands produced hurricane force wind gusts and intense precipitation, reaching. inches mm in Puerto Rico. In the United States Virgin Islands, three people died due to the hurricane, and a few homes were destroyed. In Puerto Rico, Connie destroyed homes and caused crop damage. After affecting Puerto Rico, Connie turned to the northwest, reaching peak winds of mph km h. The hurricane weakened while slowing and turning to the north, and struck North Carolina on August as a Category hurricane. Strong waves generated by the storm caused tides ft. m above average, slightly damaging coastal resorts. Weather offices advised small craft offshore to remain in port due to the strong waves. Rough seas battered the schooner Princess Friday, but the ship was able to ride out the storm. The storm produced squalls further inland, causing heavy rains. A weather station reported a minimum pressure of mbar hPa. inHg, the lowest in association with the tropical storm. Despite the strong waves and heavy rains, only minor damage was reported. A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression early on September, while located about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. After six hours, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ione. Eventually, it turned to the northwest. At UTC on September, Ione reached hurricane intensity, while situated north of the Leeward Islands. Ione continued to deep while moving northwest. The storm reached Category intensity with maximum sustained winds of mph km h and a minimum barometric pressure of mbar. inHg early on September. Around midday on the following day, it made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina as a Category hurricane. Shortly after moving inland over eastern North Carolina, Ione weakened to a tropical storm. Late on September, Ione re emerged into the Atlantic near Norfolk, Virginia. The storm quickly re strengthened early on September, but transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September. A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September and continued west northwestward. It is possible that the system developed into a tropical depression the next day, although lack of data prevented such classification until September, when a nearby ship reported winds of mph km h. An approaching cold front turned the system to the north on September. The structure gradually became better organized, and after turning to the northeast on September, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. This was based on a ship report of mph km h winds, which was also estimated as the system s peak intensity. On September, the system became extratropical and accelerated its forward motion, dissipating within a larger extratropical storm south of Iceland on the next day. A tropical wave was reported to have passed through Cape Verde on October. The system slowly developed a vertex as it curved in a generally northward direction. By early on October, two ships reported that a tropical depression formed almost halfway between the Azores and the Leeward Islands. After six hours, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. While re curving to the northeast, the storm attained its maximum sustained winds of mph km h the lowest atmospheric pressure recorded in relation to the storm was, mbar inHg, but the time of measurement is unknown. Although no significant weakening occurred, it eventually merged with an extratropical cyclone on October, while still well southwest of the Azores. During its extratropical stage, a ship in the area reported an atmospheric pressure as low as mbar. inHg. While crossing the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, Katie became very disorganized and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm early on October, within a few hours after moving inland. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean just east of Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Katie began accelerating to the northeast on October. During that time, the storm re intensified and briefly approached hurricane intensity, although it failed to strengthen further due to interaction with a cold front. After passing just east of Bermuda on October, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Katie were last observed the following day. The following names were used for tropical cyclones that reached at least tropical storm intensity in the North Atlantic in. However, two of such storms went unnamed. Connie, Diane, Ione, and Janet would later be retired. The season was tied with the and for the most storm names retired after a single season, until five names were retired in. Storms were named Brenda, Connie, Diane, Edith, Flora, Gladys, Hilda, Ione, Janet and Katie for the first time. Names not assigned are marked in gray. noitulovE is the fifth television cinema piece in the Good things come to those who wait series, and its premiere marked the end of a four year hiatus. The advert and its associated campaign were a critical and financial success. It received over awards from professional organisations in the advertising and television industries, and was the most awarded commercial worldwide in. The impact of the campaign was such that during a period in which the UK beer market experienced a substantial decline in revenue, Guinness reported that its year on year earnings within the region had noticeably increased. At the same time, Guinness achieved its highest ever volume and value shares and became the market leader within the region. This was attributed in no small part to the positive reception of noitulovE. Andrew Stuart Murray McCall born June, usually known as Stuart McCall, is a football manager and former player who is the current manager of Bradford City. He made a total of league games and in full international matches for Scotland during his playing career. McCall started his professional career with Bradford City, where he made his senior debut in. He played six seasons at Valley Parade, during which time he won the Division Three championship, a title which was overshadowed by the Bradford City stadium fire when people died and in which his father Andy was injured. After missing out on promotion in, McCall moved to Everton, for whom he scored twice but finished on the losing side in the FA Cup Final. In, he moved to Rangers, with whom he spent seven seasons and won six league titles, three Scottish Cups and two Scottish League Cups. McCall returned to Bradford City as captain to take them into the top division of English football for the first time in years. After four seasons he moved to Sheffield United, where he retired as a player in. Born and raised in England, McCall qualified to play for Scotland through his Scottish father. He won international caps and scored one goal in the FIFA World Cup in Italy. He also played in two European Championships but his international career ended after he was left out of the World Cup squad. McCall was part of the coaching staff during his second spell at Bradford City, briefly serving as caretaker player manager in. He continued his coaching at Sheffield United and was assistant manager to Neil Warnock until May, when he returned to Bradford City for a third time, this time as manager. He spent two and a half seasons in charge of Bradford City, leaving in February. Just before the end of, he was appointed Motherwell manager. He stayed at Fir Park for four years, helping the club finish second in the league twice. After a poor start to the season, he resigned in November. McCall was appointed manager of Rangers in March, but left the club at the end of a short term contract. McCall made a second appearance in an Everton shirt at Valley Parade, when he was invited by former teammate Mark Ellis to bring a side for his testimonial. In three seasons at Everton, McCall played league games as well as earned his first caps with Scotland but he failed to lift any trophies as the club finished eighth, sixth and ninth in the league. Apart from the FA Cup final defeat in, the closest he came to winning a trophy at Everton was in the season, when Everton topped the league in late autumn and remained in contention for the title for the most the rest of the season until disappointing form in the run in saw them finish sixth. On July McCall joined Sheffield United, where he played an integral part in their first team side, despite being, and also coached the reserves to the league title. He played league games over the next two seasons, and scored twice, including a winner against former side Bradford. He was in the side that reached the Division One play off final in as well as the semi finals of both cup competitions that year. However he and Dean Windass, who was also now at Sheffield United, were both left out of the play off final, as United lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers. McCall played just two League Cup games in the season, and retired just a few weeks before his st birthday. His career total of league games placed him in th position on the all time appearance list of British footballers. In July, McCall accepted his first coaching role, when he was appointed assistant manager to Chris Hutchings at Bradford City, after Hutchings was promoted from the role to replace Paul Jewell as City manager. Just four months later, Hutchings was sacked, and McCall was appointed as caretaker player manager. His first game in the role was against his former team Everton, who were led by his former manager Walter Smith, but ended with a defeat. He was in charge for one more game, which also ended in defeat, until Jim Jefferies was appointed the new manager. Jefferies brought with him his own assistant Billy Brown, and McCall was appointed first team coach. After leaving Bradford City, he joined Sheffield United, where he also took up a coaching role. When he retired in, he remained at Sheffield United as assistant to Neil Warnock. Working alongside Warnock and learning the managerial ropes from him, he helped mastermind Sheffield s promotion to the Premier League in. United were relegated to the Championship on the final day of the season and Warnock resigned three days later. McCall had already decided that the season would be his last as assistant manager, and when he was overlooked as a successor to the United manager s position, in favour of Bryan Robson, he decided to leave after five years with the club. McCall admitted in his autobiography, The Real McCall, he wanted to manage Bradford. On June, he returned as manager of Bradford City, replacing Phil Parkinson. McCall gave up his coaching role with the Scottish national team. Scores and results list Scotland s goal tally first.

From late April, after a German led Ottoman force attacked British yeomanry at Katia, British Empire forces in the region at first doubled from one brigade to two and then grew as rapidly as the developing infrastructure could support them. The construction of the railway and a water pipeline soon enabled an infantry division to join the light horse and mounted rifle brigades at Romani. During the heat of summer, regular mounted patrols and reconnaissance were carried out from their base at Romani, while the infantry constructed an extensive series of defensive redoubts. On July, the advance of a large German, Austrian and Ottoman force across the northern Sinai was reported. From July until the battle began, the Australian st and nd Light Horse Brigades took turns pushing out to clash with the advancing hostile column. By February, however, there was no apparent sign of any unusual military activity in the Sinai itself, when the British began construction on the first mile km stretch of foot inch. m standard gauge railway and water pipeline from Kantara to Romani and Katia. Reconnaissance aircraft of the Royal Flying Corps and seaplanes of the Royal Naval Air Service found only small, scattered Ottoman forces in the Sinai region and no sign of any major concentration of troops in southern Palestine. German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein s raiding force retaliated to this growing British presence, by attacking the widely dispersed th Mounted Brigade on April, Easter Sunday and also St George s Day, when Yeomanry were surprised and overwhelmed at Katia and Oghratina east of Romani. The mounted Yeomanry brigade had been sent to guard the water pipeline and railway as they were being extended beyond the protection of the Suez Canal defences into the desert towards Romani. On April, the day after the Katia and Oghratina, Chauvel, commander of the Anzac Mounted Division, was placed in command of all the advanced troops the nd Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades at Romani and an infantry division the nd Lowland at Dueidar. The infantry moved forward to Romani between May and June. At the beginning of July, it was estimated there were at least, Ottoman troops in the Gaza Beersheba area of southern Palestine, and that just before the battle began at Romani, there were, troops at Oghratina, not far from Katia, another, at the forward base of Bir el Abd, east of Oghratina, to, at Bir Bayud to the south east, and another, at Bir el Mazar, some miles km to the east, not far from El Arish. It is also possible that the st Regiment of the th Division advanced to Bir el Abd and took part in the defence of that place. The deployments on August on and near the battlefield were as follows The force at Romani, responsible for its defence when the battle began, consisted of infantry from the British nd Lowland Division, commanded by Major General W. E. B. Smith, and the Anzac Mounted Division commanded by Chauvel less the rd Light Horse Brigade. The st and nd Light Horse Brigades, less the th Light Horse Regiment, but with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade s Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment attached were commanded by Lieutenant Colonels J. B. H Meredith and J. R. Royston respectively. The threat of an Ottoman attack towards the Suez Canal had been considered by Lawrence in consultation with his divisional commanders, and a second defensive area was developed to address their concerns. Their plans took into account the possibility of an Ottoman army at Katia moving to attack Romani or following the old caravan route to assault Hill and Dueidar on their way to the Suez Canal. Any attempt to bypass Romani on the right flank would be open to attack from the garrison, which could send out infantry and mounted troops on the hard ground in the plain to the south west. The New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade was stationed at Hill at the end of June and the th Light Horse Regiment at Dueidar to prevent such an Ottoman force from reaching the Suez Canal. Having been held south of Romani, the German and Ottoman force attempted a further outflanking manoeuvre to the west, concentrating, troops around Mount Royston another sand dune, south west of Romani. At, the Ottoman st Infantry Regiment pushed forward then the nd and the th Infantry Regiments swung around the left and into the British rear. This outflanking movement was steadily progressing along the slopes of Mount Royston and turning the right of the nd Light Horse Brigade, whose third regiment, the Wellington Mounted Rifles, was now also committed to the front line. The German, Austrian and Ottoman attack on Mount Royston was checked to the north by the rd and th Light Horse Regiments st and nd Light Horse Brigades, and under constant bombardment from the horse artillery and the infantry s heavy artillery of the nd Lowland Division. At, the front held by the two light horse brigades faced south from a point yards m northwest of No. Redoubt north of Wellington Ridge to the sand hills north of Mount Royston. As the line had fallen back, the nd and rd Light Horse Regiments st Light Horse Brigade had come in between the th and th Light Horse Regiments nd Light Horse Brigade from right to left, the line was now held by the th, rd, nd and th Light Horse and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments, while mile. km north north west of Mount Royston, D Squadron of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars a regiment in the th Mounted Brigade held its ground. When the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade s headquarters and the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiments were within mile. km of Dueidar on the old caravan road, they were ordered to move directly to Canterbury Hill, the last defensible position in front of the railway, east of Pelusium Station, as the strong German and Ottoman attack was threatening to take the railway and Romani. The Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment arrived with its brigade between and to find the Composite Yeomanry Regiment th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade in contact with the German and Ottoman forces on the south west side of Mount Royston. However, Lawrence s orders for a general advance on August beginning at included an advance by the Anzac Mounted Division. His orders read Anzac Mounted Division to press forward with its right on the Hod el Enna and its left in close touch with the infantry from the th Scottish Rifles Brigade, nd Lowland Division, advancing on the line Katib Gannit to Mount Meredith. rd Light Horse Brigade to move towards Bir el Nuss and attack Hod el Enna from the south keeping in close touch with the Anzac Mounted Division. th Mounted Brigade, under orders of nd Infantry Division to assist the rd Light Horse Brigade s link with the Anzac Mounted Division s right. nd Division to move on the line Canterbury Hill Mount Royston Hod el Enna and drive back any opposition to the advance of the mounted troops in close support of Anzac Mounted Division s right flank. nd Lowland Division to move in close support of Anzac Mounted Division s left flank towards Mount Meredith and to prepare for a general advance towards Abu Hamra which was not to be undertaken until further orders from Lawrence at No. Section Headquarters. Meanwhile, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force was now spread from Hill almost to Bir en Nuss, but with their left flank unprotected. They could not have been in good shape after fighting all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main British infantry positions infantry in the nd Lowland Division was closer to the nearest enemy controlled water source at Katia than most of the attacking force. Had the British infantry left their trenches promptly and attacked in a south easterly direction, von Kressenstein s force would have had great difficulty escaping. The two day battle for Romani and the Suez Canal had been won by the British infantry and Australian, British and New Zealand mounted troops. They captured approximately, German and Ottoman combatants and killed more than, but the main enemy force was able to escape with all their artillery, except for one captured battery, and retreat back to Oghratina after fighting a successful rearguard action at Katia. Having borne the burden of the long days of patrolling, reconnaissance and minor engagements with the advancing Austrian, German and Ottoman columns prior to the battle, the st and nd Light Horse Brigades had alone withstood the attack from midnight on August until dawn on August, as well as continuing to fight during the long days of battle. By the end of August, they were completely exhausted their depleted ranks stumbled back to their bivouac lines at Romani and Etmaler where they were ordered one day s rest. Von Kressenstein had prepared successive lines of defence during his advance towards Romani, and despite losing one artillery battery and more than one third of his soldiers, fought a series of effective rearguard actions which slowed the pursuit by British Empire mounted troops and enabled his force to retreat back to El Arish. The same three brigades one mounted rifle, one light horse and one Yeomanry, with the th Light Horse Regiment rd Light Horse Brigade supporting the Yeomanry moved to attack the German and Ottoman position at Oghratina, but the rearguard position was again found to be too strong. Lacking the support of infantry or heavy artillery, the mounted force was too small to capture this strong rearguard position, but the threat from the mounted advance was enough to force the hostile force to evacuate the position. During the night, the German and Ottoman forces retreated back to Bir el Abd, where they had been three weeks before, on July, when they established a base with a depot for supplies and stores. Chauvel planned, with Lawrence s approval, to capture the Ottoman rearguard at their forward base of Bir El Abd, miles km to the east of Romani. The position was strongly held by greatly superior numbers of Germans, Austrians and Ottomans, supported by well placed artillery, but the garrison was seen burning stores and evacuating camps. The forward troops of the German and Ottoman rearguard, which held a front of about miles km, were driven back to Bir el Abd by the New Zealanders. At this time, the attackers appeared likely to succeed, as they had firmly established themselves across the telegraph line and the old caravan road, supported by the Somerset and Leicester batteries. But the German, Austrian and Ottoman rearguard quickly realised how thin the attacking line was, and at advanced out of their trenches to counterattack. This aggressive move was only checked by artillery fire from the Somerset Battery effectively combined with fire from machine guns. The subsequent fire fight made it extremely difficult for the mounted riflemen to maintain their position, and on the flanks the light horse were also held up. The German and Ottoman infantry renewed their attack towards a gap between the New Zealanders and the nd Light Horse Brigade, but the th Light Horse Regiment covered the gap, and the German and Ottoman advance was halted. Chauvel ordered the rd Light Horse Brigade, which had been unable to turn the German and Ottoman flank, to move towards the New Zealanders who renewed their efforts, but they only succeeded in exposing their flanks, as the Australians were unable to conform to their forward movement. By, all progress had stopped. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade continued to hold on in the centre, while both flanks were bent back by pressure from the strong German and Ottoman force. The result was that the New Zealanders ended up holding a very exposed salient line on the forward slopes of the hills overlooking the Hod. Fresh German or Ottoman reinforcements from El Arish, then launched a fierce counterattack on a front of about. miles. km, on the centre. This fell on the Canterbury and Auckland Regiments and a squadron of Warwickshire Yeomanry of the th Mounted Brigade under Chaytor s command. The New Zealanders were supported by machine guns one section, attached to the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment, fired all their guns directly on the advancing soldiers, stopping them when they were within yards m of the New Zealand position. After this day of fierce fighting, which has been described as the hardest fought action of the whole Sinai campaign, the Anzac Mounted Division s advance was effectively stopped. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence s wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Further, the Anzac Mounted Division had lost a significant proportion of their strength over casualties, including eight officers and other ranks killed. At daylight on August, strong patrols went forward and remained in touch with the force at Bir el Abd throughout the day, but without fresh troops, an attack in force could not be made. No serious fighting took place on August, but von Kressenstein s force at Bir el Abd was watched and harassed, and plans were made for an attack on August. The advance of the Anzac Mounted Division began at daylight, but soon afterwards, forward patrols reported that the garrison at Bir el Abd was retiring. The mounted force followed the Austrians, Germans and Ottomans as far as Salmana, where another rearguard action delayed the mounted force, as the enemy withdrawal continued back to El Arish. Von Kressenstein succeeded in withdrawing his battered force from a potentially fatal situation both his advance to Romani and the withdrawal were remarkable achievements of planning, leadership, staff work and endurance. According to the Australian official medical history, the total British Empire casualties were Other sources put the total killed at, with all casualties at, of whom were from the Anzac Mounted Division. Ottoman Army casualties have been estimated to have been, were buried after the battle and, were taken prisoner. This battle was fought under extreme conditions in the Sinai desert in midsummer heat over many days, causing much suffering to man and beast and demanding tenacity and endurance on the part of all who took part. The battle of Romani marked the end of the German and Ottoman campaign against the Suez Canal the offensive had passed decisively into the hands of the British Empire force led by the Anzac Mounted Division. After the battle, von Kressenstein s force was pushed back across the Sinai Peninsula, to be beaten at the Battle of Magdhaba in December and back to the border of Ottoman Empire controlled Palestine to be defeated at the Battle of Rafa in January, which effectively secured the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula. This successful, seven month long British Empire campaign, begun at Romani in August, ended at the First Battle of Gaza in March. It has been suggested that an opportunity was lost on August to encircle and capture the invading Austrian, German and Ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to Katia. The infantry s difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence s confusing orders for infantry in the nd Lowland Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day s battle. General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani. That the strong enemy attack on the st and nd Light Horse Brigades during the first night s battle pushed them so far back that the planned flanking attack by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade became almost a frontal attack. Lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at Kantara, which was considered to be too far from the battlefield, and that this contributed to his loss of control of the battle during the first day, when the telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with Romani. Lawrence was also criticised for not going forward to supervise the execution of his orders on August, when there was a failure to coordinate the movements of the rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column. Chauvel responded by pointing out that the criticisms of the battle were in danger of obscuring the significance of the victory. But he failed to ensure the fighting qualities of these soldiers earned them a proportionate share of recognition and honours. Further, despite claims that Chauvel alone had a clear view of the battle, that his coolness and skill were crucial in gaining the victory, his name was omitted from the long list of honours published on New Year s Day. Murray did offer Chauvel a lesser award a Distinguished Service Order for Romani which he declined. I am afraid my men will be very angry when they see it. I cannot understand why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much and the whole thing is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled.

When he died at the age of, the Daily Telegraph, Guardian and Times published his obituary, and the Museum of London added his pamphlets and placards to their collection. In his biography was included in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Philip Carter writes in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography that Green s time with the Navy affected him deeply. He was shocked by the obsession with sex. I was astonished when things were said quite openly what a husband would say to his wife when home on leave, he told the Sunday Times A Life in the Day column in. I ve always been a moral sort of person.

The boat was commissioned into the Austro Hungarian Navy in September, and served as a training boat sometimes making as many as ten cruises a month through the beginning of the First World War in. At the start of that conflict, she was one of only four operational submarines in the Austro Hungarian Navy U boat fleet. Over the first year of the war, U conducted reconnaissance cruises out of Cattaro. On August, U was damaged after an unsuccessful torpedo attack on an Italian armed merchant cruiser and, after she surfaced the next day, was sunk by a French destroyer. U s commanding officer and men died in the attack the survivors were captured. U was built as part of a plan by the Austro Hungarian Navy to competitively evaluate foreign submarine designs from Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland. The Austro Hungarian Navy authorized the construction of U and sister ship, U in by Germaniawerft of Kiel, Germany. U was laid down on March and launched on August. After completion, she was towed via Gibraltar to Pola, where she arrived on January. U s design was an improved version of Germaniawerft s design for the Imperial German Navy s first U boat, U, and featured a double hull with internal saddle tanks. The Germaniawerft engineers refined the design s hull shape through extensive model trials. U was feet inches m long by feet. m abeam and had a draft of feet inches. m. She displaced tonnes short tons surfaced and tonnes short tons submerged. She was armed with two bow centimeter. in torpedo tubes, and was designed to carry up to three torpedoes. After U s arrival at Pola in January, she was commissioned into the Austro Hungarian Navy on September as SM U. During the evaluation of the U class conducted by the Navy, the class poor diving and handling characteristics were noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U served as a training boat between and and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity. Critical reception for the episode was mixed certain critics believed the episode was not an instant classic in contrast to the other episodes of the season but called it memorable and brilliant nevertheless, while others regarded it as the black sheep of the season. The episode caused controversy in Canada for the episode s final gag, in which Peter states that Canada sucks. Chris hates being in the Youth Scouts and wants to quit, but is afraid to tell his father Peter. Chris is finally kicked out when he runs over the troop leader during a Soap Box Derby. Peter insists on driving Chris and the rest of the family Peter s wife Lois, their daughter Meg and their infant Stewie to the Youth Scout headquarters, in Manhattan, to get Chris readmitted. While they are gone, their talking dog Brian is watching Nova just as the show is interrupted to show several episodes of the sitcom One Day at a Time. He tries to change the channel, but is unable to do so nor he can turn the TV off, losing his intelligence shortly after watching a few episodes. The television show the family is watching near the beginning of the show is an episode from the ABC sitcom Happy Days. When the rest of the family is gone on the trip to Manhattan, Brian watches an episode of Nova, which is interrupted by a PBS announcement that they will be showing various episodes of One Day at a Time. When Peter has to search for his spiritual guide, it turns out to be Fonzie from Happy Days. The end of the episode features a parody of the The More You Know series of public service announcements. Insular art is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental Europe and contributed to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi precious stones, in the heavily carved high crosses found particularly in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created at the monastic centre of Iona. Scotland adopted the Romanesque style relatively late and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors. From the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies. Native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items. Visual illustration can be seen in the illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. Architectural evidence suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked in much of Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland in the second half of the twelfth century and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the English perpendicular style that had come to dominate. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France. Humpty Dumpty is a character in an English nursery rhyme, probably originally a riddle and one of the best known in the English speaking world. He is typically portrayed as an anthropomorphic egg, though he is not explicitly described so. The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth century England and the tune from in James William Elliott s National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings. The rhyme is one of the best known and most popular in the English language. The most common modern text is I don t know what you mean by glory, Alice said. But glory doesn t mean a nice knock down argument, Alice objected. The question is, said Alice, whether you can make words mean so many different things. The question is, said Humpty Dumpty, which is to be master that s all. The face is what one goes by, generally, Alice remarked in a thoughtful tone. That s just what I complain of, said Humpty Dumpty. Your face is the same as everybody has the two eyes, marking their places in the air with his thumb nose in the middle, mouth under. It s always the same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instance or the mouth at the top that would be some help. A variation on the poem using near sounding French nonsense words is often used to illustrate the difficulty of speech recognition in different languages. A common version is as follows To a listener expecting a nursery rhyme, it will generally be heard as the English version, while someone expecting French will instead tend to hear nonsense words. In the organisation was registered as a limited company, and the Cardiff season was extended from one week to two. The following year the company gave its first performances in Swansea. The chorus featured performers by this time. In the late s WNO combined with the Cardiff based Welsh Drama Company, becoming the Welsh National Opera and Drama Company. The work of the drama company came under continued criticism, the Welsh Arts Council cut its grant, and the partnership ended in with the formal closure of the Welsh Drama Company.

Their home ground is Twickenham Stadium where they first played in. The team is administered by the Rugby Football Union RFU. Four former players have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame one of these is also a member of the IRB Hall of Fame. Seven other former players are members of the IRB Hall four solely for their accomplishments as players, two solely for their achievements in other roles in the sport, and one for achievements both as a player and administrator. England first played New Zealand the All Blacks in. The All Blacks scored five tries, worth three points at this time, to win. The following year, they played France for the first time, and later that year they first faced South Africa known as the Springboks James Peters was withdrawn from the England squad after the South Africans objected to playing against a black player. The match was drawn. England first played France in, and Australia known as the Wallabies in when they were defeated. Don White was appointed as England s first ever coach in. According to former Northampton player Bob Taylor, Don was chosen because he was the most forward thinking coach in England. His first match in charge was an victory over South Africa at Twickenham in. Of the eleven games England played with White in charge they won three, and drew one and lost seven. He resigned as England coach in. England started the following decade with a Grand Slam victory in the Five Nations their first for years.

It was also the first time every team managed to win at least competition points the equivalent of a win and a draw or three draws since. However, England did again defeat Scotland for the Calcutta Cup at Twickenham. England have typically worn all white shirts, white shorts with navy and white socks. The emblem on the shirts is a red rose, rather than the Plantagenet Three Lions displayed on the shirts of the England football and cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O is the shirt sponsor. Red was the change strip, although prior to the introduction of the red strip, navy blue was used. Purple was used as the change strip as of the autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England track suits from the s, s and s. For the Rugby World Cup the change kit was black. In England first used a skin tight strip. This was intended to make it more difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling. The home and away strips for were unveiled on May that year. The materials used are superior, offering improved performance to the kit. However, a sweeping red mark on the base white front which forms St George s Cross on the top left, and a changed away strip dark blue to red, have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis has been placed on St George s Cross at the expense of the traditional red rose. The new strip was introduced in England s home game against Wales on August, while the alternative strip was first used against France on August. England competes annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales.

On April Winiowiecki received the office of the voivode of Ruthenia, which granted him a seat in the Senate of Poland. He was the third member of the Winiowiecki family to gain that privilege. Soon afterward, however, he refused to support King Wadysaw s plan for a war against the Ottoman Empire, even though the King offered him the rank of a Field Crown Hetman. Despite his wealth, he was not known for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not know for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single portrait of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Winiowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes that much of the historiography concerning Winiowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates. Credits adapted from the liner notes for Fortune HMS Black Prince was a Duke of Edinburgh class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the mid s. She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau. After the German ships reached Ottoman waters, the ship was sent to the Red Sea in mid August to protect troop convoys arriving from India and to search for German merchant ships. After capturing two ships, Black Prince was transferred to the Grand Fleet in December and was sunk during the Battle of Jutland in May, with all hands killed. Two armoured cruisers of a new design, Duke of Edinburgh and Black Prince, the latter named for Edward, the Black Prince, were ordered for the Royal Navy as part of the Naval Estimates. They were the first ships to be designed for the Royal Navy under the supervision of the new Director of Naval Construction, Sir Philip Watts. The new design was significantly larger than the previous Monmouth and Devonshire class cruisers, mounting a heavier main armament of six. in mm guns in single turrets. Black Prince was modified in March as a result of lessons learned at the Battle of Coronel, with the inch guns removed from their casemates and replaced by six inch guns mounted individually behind shields between the beam. inch turrets. The ship participated in the Battle of Jutland, where she was sunk with heavy loss of life. The circumstances under which she sank were mysterious for some years after. As the British had lost contact and did not see the ship destroyed, they were unsure as to whether a submarine or surface ship was responsible for sinking Black Prince. During the battle, the st Cruiser Squadron was deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the Grand Fleet, but Black Prince lost contact with the rest of the Squadron as it came into contact with German forces, at about. Soon after, two other members of the st Cruiser Squadron, Defence and Warrior were heavily engaged by German battleships and battlecruisers, with Defence blowing up and Warrior receiving heavy damage, which later caused her to sink. In, Baltimore experienced high rates of murder and unemployment, and had a failing city school system. O Malley declared his candidacy, focusing his campaign on a zero tolerance approach to crime. He received endorsements from many of the city s African American leaders. After a close race, O Malley overtook both Stokes and Bell to win the Democratic nomination, which all but assured him of victory in the general election. He defeated Republican candidate David F. Tufaro in the general election by an overwhelming majority. Kurt Schmoke, the incumbent Mayor of Baltimore, was serving his third term. He announced in December that he would not run for reelection the following year, the first time an incumbent Baltimore mayor did not run for reelection since. Schmoke was the first African American mayor in Baltimore s history. O Malley initially supported Bell s candidacy. Bell urged O Malley to endorse him, and offered him the job of city solicitor in exchange for his support. However, O Malley began to distance himself from Bell, not appearing at Bell s campaign announcement, due to disagreements on several bills debated at the City Council. Bell s supporters attempted to convince O Malley to run for City Council President, but O Malley announced his decision to run for mayor in June, becoming the first major candidate in the race who was Caucasian. He began the campaign largely unknown outside of Northeast Baltimore. Republican Party officials quickly began to back Tufaro, who criticized the Democratic Party by pointing out that Democrats have led Baltimore in its decline. Fifteen candidates ended up running in the Democratic primary. The front runners were considered to be O Malley, Bell, and Stokes. Schmoke made no endorsement in the race. O Malley and Bell called for zero tolerance to all crime, though Stokes felt this policy was biased against minorities. Stokes ran on the issue of education, as he was a former member of the Baltimore school board, in addition to the city council. Stokes vowed to reduce class sizes and reverse the trend of citizens of Baltimore leaving the city to live in nearby suburbs. Bell led Stokes in a poll conducted early in the race, to, before O Malley declared his candidacy. By late August, Bell slipped in the polls to third place, with O Malley and Stokes tied. Bell and O Malley began airing television commercials supporting their campaigns in early August, while Stokes did not begin to air commercials until September. O Malley also advertised on the radio. In the September Republican primary, Tufaro received over half of the votes cast. Adair finished in second place. Tufaro criticized O Malley s zero tolerance policy, suggesting it would lead to increased police brutality towards minorities. He instead proposed continuing Mayor Schmoke s community policing strategy. Opponents of the zero tolerance policy tried to tie O Malley to the Baltimore Police shooting of an African American car theft suspect. O Malley was ineligible to run in the gubernatorial election due to term limits. O Malley publicly expressed interest in a presidential run in on multiple occasions. At a press conference at a National Governors Association meeting, O Malley stated he was laying the framework for a presidential run. Show creator David Simon denied that the character of Tommy Carcetti was supposed to be O Malley, though he did acknowledge that O Malley was one of several inspirations for Carcetti. He further stated that while Carcetti was reflective of O Malley, Carcetti was a composite drawing aspects from other local politicians that he had covered when he worked as a reporter for The Baltimore Sun. An international conference that the Government of Pondicherry and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs held in October decided to investigate the Arikamedu site jointly for conservation, as its ancient commercial link with the Romans has been established. During this conference, the Government of Pondicherry also decided to propose the site for status as a World Heritage Site of UNESCO. The Archaeological Survey of India also proposed the site for UNESCO Cultural Heritage Site status, under the title Silk Road Sites in India. On August, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa, which moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development. On September, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, developed along the northern portion of the wave, but was eventually absorbed into Tropical Storm Gabrielle north of Puerto Rico. The wave continued westward through the Caribbean Sea into a large area of cyclonic flow at the surface, which extended across Central America into the eastern Pacific. Around September, the broad system developed two areas of disturbed weather one in the eastern Pacific would become Hurricane Manuel, and the other developing over the northwestern Caribbean. The latter system slowly organized, developing a low pressure area on September. Subsequently, the system moved over the Yucatn Peninsula. Although land interaction prevented immediate development, conditions favored further development in the Bay of Campeche. Early on September, the low emerged into the bay, and at UTC the National Hurricane Center NHC assessed that Tropical Depression Ten developed about km mi east northeast of Veracruz. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight indicating the presence of a closed low level circulation. After weakening into a remnant low, Felicia continued to approach the Hawaiian Islands and on August, the system produced copious amounts of rainfall across several islands. The highest total was recorded on Oahu at. in mm, causing isolated mudslides and flooding. In Maui, the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages, significantly increasing the total water across the island s reservoirs. In addition, river flooding resulted in the closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm resulted in several lifeguard rescues at island beaches. In all, only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of Felicia. After slightly weakening throughout the day on August, Felicia leveled out with winds of mph km h and a mi km wide eye as the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, which would allow Felicia to maintain a high intensity over marginally warm waters. Early the next day, the structure of the hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly. This marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal Category hurricane. Several hours later, the mid level circulation began to separate from the low level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased. By this time, the storm began to take a long anticipated westward turn towards Hawaii. After briefly re intensifying on August, Felicia weakened to a Category hurricane early on August. Around am HST UTC, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center CPHC took over responsibility of issuing advisories as Felicia crossed longitude W. By August, increasing wind shear further weakened the storm, with Felicia being downgraded to a tropical storm early that day. The storm rapidly weakened throughout the day as convection gradually dissipated around the center due to the shear. By the late morning hours, little convective activity remained around the low pressure center of Felicia. A weak cyclone, the storm continued to track towards Hawaii with the only deep convection associated with it being displaced to the northeast of the center. The system slowly weakened before being downgraded to a tropical depression on August as no areas of tropical storm force winds were found by Hurricane Hunters. Several hours after being downgraded, the CPHC issued its final advisory on Felicia as it degenerated into a remnant low near the Hawaiian Islands. The system dissipated shortly thereafter. The liner notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes list the song s personnel as Dylan, guitar and vocals Robertson, guitar Hudson, organ Manuel, piano Danko, bass and Helm, drums. However, Griffin argues that Helm did not arrive in Woodstock until after the song is believed to have been recorded. Furthermore, the drumming sounds to Griffin more like Manuel s style. Heylin and biographer Greil Marcus similarly do not include Santa Fe among the songs they believe were recorded after Helm s arrival. Griffin also argues that no organ is audible on the track and proposes the following musician line up as being more likely Dylan, acoustic guitar and vocals Robertson, electric guitar Hudson, piano Danko, bass Manuel, drums.

Some of Balliett s real world ideas in Chasing Vermeer were Do coincidences mean anything, and What is art and what makes it valuable, Balliett says her central message is kids are powerful thinkers, and their ideas are valuable, and that adults don t have all the answers. Deception and problem solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players use a variety of ways to hide the truth while the children employ a series of mathematical and problem solving concepts to piece together the clues to the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art. Warner Brothers bought the rights to a film of Chasing Vermeer in June and Brad Pitt s production company Plan B Entertainment planned to produce it. P.J. Hogan was slated as director and the novel was adapted by Matt Nix. However, when asked about the film in August, Balliett answered, It s been fascinating, watching this whole process, because Plan B did a wonderful job. They went through two screenwriters, and they ve gone through two directors. It s sort of like a house of cards. I have rights again. If they get it all together again, they ll jump on it. But they don t have exclusive rights anymore. Caught Up is a song by American R B singer Usher. It was written by Ryan Toby, Andre Harris, Vidal Davis and Jason Boyd, and produced by Dre Vidal for Usher s album Confessions.

The singer continued, saying that he asked Rihanna to do some bits and pieces in the recording studio and that it came together very quickly. Levine stated that if there is magic between two artists, then you don t even have to think about it. During the interview, Rihanna confirmed that the song would be the only one to feature a collaboration on her re release of Good Girl Gone Bad, revealing that she had always wanted to work with the group and was honored when they contacted her.

Recording Personnel Her works have gained a great deal of popularity, and have been performed in multiple video game music concerts, including one, Sinfonia Drammatica, that was focused half on her greatest hits album, Drammatica The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura, and half on the music of a previous concert. Music from several of her games have been published as arranged albums, or as piano scores. Over the next few years, she composed the soundtrack to several games, including Parasite Eve and Legend of Mana. Of all her compositions, Shimomura considers the soundtrack to Legend of Mana the one that best expresses herself and the soundtrack remains Shimomura s personal favourite. Parasite Eve on the PlayStation had the first soundtrack by Shimomura that included a vocal song, as it was the first game she had written for running on a console system that had the sound capability for one. In she wrote the score for Kingdom Hearts, which she has said is the most special soundtrack to her, as well as a turning point in her career she named the soundtracks to Street Fighter II and Super Mario RPG as the other two significant points in her life as a composer.

As it was the final episode they ran, Oakley and Weinstein wanted to end on a good note, with Weinstein stating that the episode was meant to embody the humor, depth, and emotions of The Simpsons. They also wished to have an episode they ran that was based on the background of every character they could do, and believed that this episode came out well. The name of the episode was the center of an argument that Oakley and Goldreyer had, as Oakley had originally wanted to have the episode named Lisa the Simpson, although Goldreyer wanted to name it Suddenly Stupid, a pun on a show that had been airing at the time called Suddenly Susan. In its original broadcast, Lisa the Simpson finished th in ratings for the week of March, with a Nielsen rating of., equivalent to approximately. million viewing households. It was the second highest rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X Files. Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein greatly enjoyed the episode and thought of it as a great final episode that they ran. On the DVD audio commentary, writer Ned Goldreyer stated, I think this might have been the best episode ever produced. In the colonial United States the nuclear family was the most common family form. Typical families consisted of five or more children initially because of high infant mortality rates, only a few children survived adolescence. Colonial families existed to serve six main functions self sufficient business, school, vocational institute, church, house of correction, and welfare institution. The modern family is commonly thought to have originated in the s courtship became more open, marriages were often based on affection, and parents devoted more attention to children. At the beginning of the th century, married couples began to emphasize the importance of sexual attraction and compatibility in their relationships. This led to more intimate and open relationships along with more adolescent freedom. The transition of the family was influenced by the Great Depression, which forced many women into the workplace in order to compensate for lack of financial stability. In, a federal executive order stated that only one spouse could work for the federal government. This resulted in many women being forced to resign allowing their husbands to continue working. The s saw a baby boom in America. This period was also called the Golden s. This was credited to families trying to make up lost time after the war. As a result, many families moved to the suburbs instead of residing in the city, the number of two income families began to increase, and grown children began to remain at home longer because of financial difficulties. Gradually, women began re entering the workforce. This progression away from the traditional view of the woman as the homemaker led to the creation of the role of the stay at home dad. Stay at home dads have been seen in increasing numbers in Western culture, especially in Canada, the UK and the United States since the late th century. In developed East Asian nations such as Japan and South Korea, this practice is less common. There are several reasons why some families feel that it would be more beneficial for the father to be the primary caregiver while the mother works outside of the home. The decision to use a stay at home dad arrangement is most commonly due to economic reasons. At the same time, women are progressing into higher paying jobs. There are now financial ramifications in deciding whether the mother or father should become the stay at home parent. In cases where the woman is the higher paid parent, it makes more economic sense for her to continue to work while the man takes on the caregiver role. It also makes sense at times the mother s job offers health benefits for the family whereas the father s does not. It has also been shown that if the pregnancy was jointly planned, the father is more likely to be involved. One study by the American Heart Association suggested stay at home dads may face a higher risk of heart disease. The reasons for the health risk are not specified. The role of stay at home dad may be difficult for men who feel as though they had no option. It is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker. Men who willingly choose to become a stay at home dad are much more satisfied with their role in the family. No longer the Money Maker in the family, may become an issue due to not being the main support and rock for the family. Missing their children. Becoming the main source of income for the family and working long hours away from home and family. Will lose less time with their children and will devote of their day to work force and to their children. There have been many studies done which suggest the importance of the paternal role in a child s life and benefits of the stay at home dad. Children respond differently to males and females at birth. Stay at home dads make up a very small portion of the Australian population although this appears to be rapidly changing. In, of fathers with children aged under years were employed with employed full time. Because of this, there are few role models or resources that can help Australian fathers with the stay at home dad role. The Australian Bureau of Statistics show that approximately of two parents families with children under the age of have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full time. Stay at home dads in Australia have almost doubled over the past decade from, to, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the th century. The idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise. Stay at home dads are not prevalent in East Asian countries, which generally have strict traditional gender roles. However, a survey conducted in in Japan suggested that nearly one third of married men would accept the role. The Japanese government passed a law in April allowing time off following the birth of a child for both male and female employees. In,. of Japanese fathers took time off of work to raise children. In South Korea, about, men were stay at home dads in. Even so, stay at home dads face discrimination from stay at home mothers, and are often ostracized. According to an article by the Daily Mail, the number of stay at home dads in had increased by percent since. According to the same paper, in, recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed more than, fathers chose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver for their children.

Plunketts Creek is an approximately. mile long. km tributary of Loyalsock Creek in Lycoming and Sullivan counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Two unincorporated villages and a hamlet are on the creek, and its watershed drains. square miles km in parts of five townships. The creek is a part of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin via Loyalsock Creek and the West Branch Susquehanna and Susquehanna Rivers. Although the Plunketts Creek watershed was clear cut and home to a tannery, sawmills, and a coal mine in the nineteenth century, today it is heavily wooded and known for its high water quality, fishing, and other recreational opportunities. The watershed now includes parts of the Loyalsock State Forest, Pennsylvania State Game Lands, and a State Game Farm for raising pheasant. Tourism, hunting, and fishing have long been important in the region, and its year round population is increasing much faster than that of either Lycoming or Sullivan County. During the American Revolution, Plunkett did not actively support the revolution and thus was suspected of being sympathetic to the British Empire. He died in, aged about, and was buried in Northumberland, without a grave marker or monument except for the creek that bears his name. Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County in. When Plunketts Creek Township was formed in Lycoming County in, the original name proposed was Plunkett Township but the lingering suspicions of his British sympathies led to that name being rejected. Naming the township for the creek was an acceptable compromise. Plunketts Creek Township was originally much larger than it is now, and two other townships were formed from parts of it. When Sullivan County was formed from Lycoming County on March, Plunketts Creek Township was divided between the counties, with each having a township of the same name. This led to some confusion and in the citizens of Sullivan County petitioned the state legislature to change the name of their Plunketts Creek Township to Hillsgrove Township, for Hillsgrove, the main village and post office in the township. In, Cascade Township was formed from parts of Hepburn and Plunketts Creek Townships in Lycoming County. The previous record flood reached. feet. m on the Loyalsock flood gauge at Barbours on January,. This major flood resulted from heavy rain, snow melt, and ice dams, which caused millions of dollars of damage throughout Lycoming County, and six deaths on Lycoming Creek in and near Williamsport. On Plunketts Creek, the flood heavily damaged and later caused the demolition of Plunketts Creek Bridge No., a mid th century stone arch bridge listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The flood waters were feet. m deep in Barbours and it was called the village s worst flood in history at the time. The named tributaries together account for. of the Plunketts Creek watershed. The largest tributary is Wolf Run, with an area of. square miles. km, accounting for. of the total. The Wolf Run drainage basin includes both the Noon Branch. square miles. km and the Brian Branch. square miles. km. The next largest tributary of Plunketts Creek is King Run with. square miles. km or. of the watershed. The King Run watershed includes Engle Run, with. square miles. km. The third largest tributary is Dry Run with. square miles. km or., followed by the unnamed tributary in Coal Mine Hollow with. square miles. km or.. All other named tributaries are less than. square mile. km and account for less than of the drainage basin individually. Plunketts Creek does not have its own watershed association, but is part of the larger Loyalsock Creek Watershed Association. Cresswell started his career with York City in their youth system, making his first team debut in a Second Division match in. Having scored goals for York in the season he signed for Premier League team Sheffield Wednesday in. After their relegation the following year he joined Leicester City of the Premier League, but was loaned to First Division side Preston North End in and played for them in the First Division play off Final. He signed for Preston permanently in the summer. He had four full seasons with Preston, scoring a career best goals in the season, which culminated in defeat in the Championship play off Final. He signed for Championship rivals Leeds United in. He had a number of knee injuries while with Leeds and following their relegation to League One in was signed by Stoke City. With Stoke he won promotion to the Premier League as Championship runners up, with Cresswell scoring goals in the season. He spent one full season in the Premier League with Stoke before signing for Championship side Sheffield United on loan in, before signing permanently in. United were relegated to League One in, and Cresswell played in their defeat in the League One play off Final. He was made player coach at the club in before rejoining his first club York City in, initially on loan. Having failed to score in appearances for York in the season, Cresswell joined Third Division side Mansfield Town on loan on March, making his debut in a draw away to Exeter City on March. He scored his first and only goal for Mansfield in a win away to Rochdale on April, before finishing the loan with five appearances. He scored four goals in games for York in, and during this season he was barracked by a small section of the York support. He made a move to Premier League side Sheffield Wednesday on a four year contract on March, with the, fee being the highest received for a York player. On his transfer, Cresswell said This move is no disrespect to York, it s just that I have always wanted to play at a much bigger club and as high as possible. Manager Danny Wilson described Cresswell as one for the future after admitting the player is not the striker people may perceive as the big one we were chasing. His debut came in Wednesday s home defeat to Coventry City on April, before scoring his first goal with an th minute winner at home to Liverpool in a win on May. He finished the season with one goal in seven games for Wednesday. Cresswell completed the season with two goals in appearances, having been given few opportunities in the team, as Wednesday were relegated to the First Division. Cresswell joined First Division club Preston North End on loan for the remainder of the season on March and scored five minutes into his debut, a win at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on March. He came on as an nd minute substitute in their defeat to Bolton Wanderers in the First Division play off Final at the Millennium Stadium on May. After scoring two goals in appearances he signed for Preston permanently on a four year contract for a fee of, on July. Having damaged his knee ligaments during the play off semi final, Cresswell missed the start of the season, making his first appearance in Leeds home defeat to Stoke City on October. However, he sustained a knee injury in November, after scoring his first goal of the campaign in Leeds home win over Colchester United on November. His return from injury came as a th minute substitute in a victory at home to Crystal Palace on February. Cresswell scored in successive games against Sheffield Wednesday and Luton Town in March, but Leeds were eventually relegated to League One. He finished the season with four goals in games. Having struggled for appearances with Stoke since their promotion to the Premier League, Cresswell joined Championship outfit Sheffield United on a three month loan on September and made his debut the same day as a th minute substitute against Ipswich Town in a home draw. Starting the following game he scored a th minute equaliser against Doncaster Rovers in a draw at home on October. He joined United permanently on a one and a half year contract for an undisclosed fee on January, going on to finish the season as top scorer with goals. He was rewarded with a new three year contract with the club in June. He scored five goals in games in the season as United were relegated to League One. Cresswell rejoined his first club York City, playing in League Two, on a one month loan on March. He marked his second York debut by scoring a rd minute penalty kick on March away at Torquay United in a defeat. He played an important role as York fought against relegation, scoring twice in five appearances, before being recalled by new United caretaker manager Chris Morgan on April. In July new United manager David Weir stated that Cresswell would be leaving the club, before he signed for York permanently on a one year contract on July. His first appearance after signing permanently came in the first game of the season, a home win over Northampton Town on August. Cresswell retired from playing on December, as a result of an eye complaint and a knee injury. He made eight appearances for York in the season. As of match played April. As of November. Stoke City Football League Championship runner up Individual Preston North End Player of the Year Berhtwald s period as archbishop coincided with the end of Wilfrid s long struggle to regain the Bishopric of York, and the two year delay between Theodore s death and Berhtwald s election may have been due to efforts to select Wilfrid for Canterbury. After his election, Berhtwald went to Gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the Wilfrid issue, finally succeeding at the second council in. Berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in Western Europe. Xenon is a member of the zero valence elements that are called noble or inert gases. It is inert to most common chemical reactions such as combustion, for example because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. Unlike the lower mass noble gases, the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside a star does not form xenon. Elements more massive than iron have a net energy cost to produce through fusion, so there is no energy gain for a star when creating xenon. Instead, xenon is formed during supernova explosions, by the slow neutron capture process s process of red giant stars that have exhausted the hydrogen at their cores and entered the asymptotic giant branch, in classical nova explosions and from the radioactive decay of elements such as iodine, uranium and plutonium. After Neil Bartlett s discovery in that xenon can form chemical compounds, a large number of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen. Three fluorides are known XeF, XeF, and XeF. XeF is theorized to be unstable. The fluorides are the starting point for the synthesis of almost all xenon compounds. The solid, crystalline difluoride XeF is formed when a mixture of fluorine and xenon gases is exposed to ultraviolet light. Ordinary daylight is sufficient. Long term heating of XeF catalyst yields XeF. F, and anions such as XeF, XeF is formed by the reduction of XeF by xenon gas. XeF is also able to form coordination complexes with transition metal ions. Over such complexes have been synthesized and characterized. Three oxides of xenon are known xenon trioxide XeO and xenon tetroxide XeO Xenon does not react with oxygen directly the trioxide is formed by the hydrolysis of XeF XeF H O XeO HF XeO anion. Ba H H O XeO To prevent decomposition, the xenon tetroxide thus formed is quickly cooled to form a pale yellow solid. It explodes above. C into xenon and oxygen gas., XeOF, XeO F, and XeO. XeOF with xenon gas at low temperatures. It may also be obtained by the partial hydrolysis of XeF and XeO F. XeOF is formed by the partial hydrolysis of XeF, or the reaction of XeF with sodium perxenate, Na. The latter reaction also produces a small amount of XeO. XeOF anion. C F F C F F C F XeF C F F, at C. Sb F The compound Xe F Although xenon is rare and relatively expensive to extract from the Earth s atmosphere, it has a number of applications. The individual cells in a plasma display use a mixture of xenon and neon that is converted into a plasma using electrodes. The interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet photons, which then excite the phosphor coating on the front of the display. Xenon has been used as a general anesthetic. Although it is expensive, anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about to appear on the European market, because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable. Because of the xenon atom s large, flexible outer electron shell, the NMR spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions, and can therefore be used as a probe to measure the chemical circumstances around it. For instance xenon dissolved in water, xenon dissolved in hydrophobic solvent, and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by NMR. In nuclear energy applications, xenon is used in bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a high molecular weight and inert nature is desirable. A by product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon and xenon. The detection of these isotopes is used to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, as well as to confirm nuclear test explosions by states such as North Korea. When Duarte suddenly died and his mistress and their children sought to attend his funeral, there was an unpleasant scene at the church gates. Although Juana and the children were permitted to enter and pay their respects to Duarte, they were promptly directed out of the church. Mrs. Juan Duarte did not want her husband s mistress and children at the funeral and, as those of the legitimate wife, her orders were respected. After his release from prison, Juan Pern decided to campaign for the presidency of the nation, which he won in a landslide. Eva campaigned heavily for her husband during his presidential bid. Using her weekly radio show, she delivered powerful speeches with heavy populist rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with Pern s movement. Though she had become wealthy from her radio and modeling success, she highlighted her own humble upbringing as a way of showing solidarity with the impoverished classes. Eva then visited Rome, where the reception was not as warm as it had been in Spain. Though Pope Pius XII did not give her a Papal decoration, she was allowed the time usually allotted queens and was given a rosary. Members of the Peronist opposition speculated that the true purpose of the European tour was to deposit funds in a Swiss bank account. The opposition in Buenos Aires, write Fraser and Navarro, assumed that the genuine purpose of the whole European visit was for Eva and her husband to deposit money in Swiss bank accounts, and that the rest had been devised to conceal this. Many wealthy Argentines did this, but there are many more convenient and less conspicuous ways of depositing money in Swiss accounts than meeting the Swiss Foreign Minister and being shown around a watch factory. Fraser and Navarro conclude, Was there a Swiss bank account, It seems unlikely. A new women s suffrage bill was introduced, which the Senate of Argentina sanctioned on August. It was necessary to wait more than a year before the House of Representatives sanctioned it on September. Law, established the equality of political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law, was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, however, Juan Pern signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed the bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers. In, Evita set her sights on earning a place on the ballot as candidate for vice president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the President in the event of the President s death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Pern s death was not something the military could accept. She did, however, receive great support from the working class, the unions, and the Peronist Women s Party. The intensity of the support she drew from these groups is said to have surprised even Juan Pern himself. Fraser and Navarro write that the wide support Evita s proposed candidacy generated indicated to him that Evita had become as important to members of the Peronist party as Juan Pern himself was. In a ceremony a few days after Juan Pern s second inauguration, Evita was given the official title of Spiritual Leader of the Nation. There were different interpretations of the popular mourning of Eva Pern s death. Some reporters viewed the mourning as authentic, others saw a public succumbing to another of the passion plays of the Peronist regime. Time magazine reported that the Peronist government enforced the observance of a daily period of five minutes of mourning following a daily radio announcement. In the book Eva Pern The Myths of a Woman, cultural anthropologist Julie M. Taylor claims that Evita has remained important in Argentina due to the combination of three unique factors Halo Uprising is a four issue American comic book limited series set in the Halo universe. The series was written by Brian Michael Bendis, illustrated by Alex Maleev, and published by Marvel Comics. Uprising tells a story set between the ending of the video game Halo and the beginning of its sequel, Halo, as Earth is under attack by a collective of alien races known as the Covenant. The series was intended to be released and concluded before Halo shipped on September, but the final issue did not appear until April. The series was brought together by Ruwan Jayatilleke, Marvel s Vice President of Development. He attained the license to publish Halo comics, including the single volume The Halo Graphic Novel, in. The graphic novel s critical and commercial success prompted Marvel to announce a new Halo limited series in with Jayatilleke serving as the series editor. Bendis, a long time Halo fan, was excited about adding to the franchise story. Reception to the series was lukewarm. The series artistic style was generally praised. However, the lack of Master Chief focused action and character development as well as the delays in publishing led to average reviews. The series was commercially successful and appeared in the top slot of The New York Times Graphic Books bestsellers list. On board the Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is captured and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle in an effort to escape. Ruwan reveals that the Key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children James told the Covenant about the Key in order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant s leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet s guards and find a way off the ship. Learning that there is no way to change the Forerunner ship s destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using a piece of the vessel as a heat shield. Halo Uprising was a commercial success. The first issue sold out within hours, leading Marvel to reissue the installment. The collected hardcover edition was the best selling hardcover graphic book for the week ending June, according to The New York Times. Most of the principal photography was done in Los Angeles, California, where the film is set. Several scenes were filmed in Utah and at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The film was poorly received by critics, but nevertheless turned out to be a box office success, grossing US million million in dollars. It spawned one theatrical sequel Species II, as well as two direct to video sequels Species III and Species The Awakening. Species was adapted into a novel by Yvonne Navarro and two comic book series by Dark Horse Comics, one of which was written by Feldman. Natasha Henstridge as Sil Michelle Williams as Young Sil Ben Kingsley as Xavier Fitch Michael Madsen as Preston Press Lennox Alfred Molina as Dr. Stephen Arden Marg Helgenberger as Dr. Laura Baker John of Brienne c. March, also known as John I, was King of Jerusalem from to and Latin Emperor of Constantinople from to. He was the youngest son of Erard II of Brienne, a wealthy nobleman in Champagne. John, originally destined for an ecclesiastical career, became a knight and owned small estates in Champagne around. After the death of his brother, Walter III, he ruled the County of Brienne on behalf of his minor nephew Walter IV who lived in southern Italy. Andrew II decided to return home, leaving the crusaders camp with Hugh I and Bohemond IV in early. Although military action was suspended after their departure, the crusaders restored fortifications at Caesarea and Atlit. After new troops arrived from the Holy Roman Empire in April, they decided to invade Egypt. They elected John supreme commander, giving him the right to rule the land they would conquer. His leadership was primarily nominal, since he could rarely impose his authority on an army of troops from many countries. The crusaders laid siege to Damietta, on the Nile, in May. Although they seized a strategically important tower on a nearby island on August, Al Kamil who had succeeded Al Adil I in Egypt controlled traffic on the Nile. In September, reinforcements commanded by Pope Honorius III s legate Cardinal Pelagius who considered himself the crusade s supreme commander arrived from Italy. Egyptian forces attempted a surprise attack on the crusaders camp on October, but John discovered their movements. He and his retinue attacked and annihilated the Egyptian advance guard, hindering the main force. The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm blew it near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on August without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated. During the ensuing panic, only the cooperation of John, the Templars, the Hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the Egyptians from destroying their camp. Stephanie died shortly after John s arrival. Contemporary sources accused John of causing her sudden death, claiming that he severely beat her when he heard that she tried to poison his daughter Isabella. Their only son died a few weeks later, ending John s claim to Cilicia. Soon after Pope Honorius learned about the deaths of Stephanie and her son, he declared Raymond Roupen the lawful ruler of Cilicia and threatened John with excommunication if he fought for his late wife s inheritance. The Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Robert I, died in January. His brother Baldwin II succeeded him, but a regent was needed to rule the Latin Empire since Baldwin was ten years old. Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria was willing to accept the regency, but the barons of the Latin Empire suspected that he wanted to unite the Latin Empire with Bulgaria. They offered the imperial crown instead to John, an ally of the Holy See. Boise National Forest is within the Idaho Batholith ecoregion, which is a level III ecoregion in the larger level I Northwestern Forested Mountains. In addition to species listed or proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, the Forest Service maintains an independent listing of sensitive species for which it is directed to develop and implement management practices to ensure that species do not become threatened or endangered because of Forest Service actions. As of February there were species in Boise National Forest listed as sensitive species mammals, amphibian, fish, birds, and plants. Gray wolves are top predators that were reintroduced amidst controversy to central Idaho in the mid s to restore ecosystem stability. The wolves have since expanded their range and established packs in most of Boise National Forest. Wolves and mountain lions are the forest s top large mammal predators and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the forest s native mammal species are present in the forest, with the exception of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct, and plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the s but have not progressed. Pokiri was released on April, to positive critical feedback, and collected a distributor s share of million. The film grossed million worldwide and remained the highest grossing Telugu film for three years, until it was surpassed by Magadheera in. The film was also one of the fourteen southern Indian films to be screened at the International Indian Film Academy Awards IIFA Film festival in. The film won four Nandi Awards and two Filmfare Awards. The film s success catapulted D Cruz into stardom and brought recognition to Jagannadh as a writer and director. The Bahrain Grand Prix formally the V Gulf Air Bahrain Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on April at the Bahrain International Circuit, in Sakhir, Bahrain. It was the third race of the Formula One season. The lap race was won by Felipe Massa for the Ferrari team. Kimi Rikknen was second in the other Ferrari, and BMW Sauber driver Robert Kubica was third. The race began with Kubica in pole position alongside Massa Lewis Hamilton, the eventual Drivers Champion, started from third, alongside Rikknen. Kubica was passed by Massa into the first corner, and then by Rikknen on the third lap. The Ferraris dominated at the front of the race, leading to their one two finish. Hamilton had a slow start after almost stalling on the grid, and dropped back to ninth. The McLaren driver ran into the back of Fernando Alonso s Renault a lap later, breaking off the McLaren s front wing and dropping Hamilton to the back of the field. Kubica s strong finish promoted BMW Sauber to the lead in the Constructors Championship, after BMW driver Nick Heidfeld finished fourth. Ferrari and McLaren trailed, one and two points behind, respectively. Rikknen took the lead in the Drivers Championship, with points, three points ahead of Heidfeld and five ahead of Hamilton, Kubica and Kovalainen, with races remaining in the season. A week before the start of the Grand Prix weekend, the News of the World alleged that Max Mosley, the president of Formula One s governing body, the Fdration Internationale de l Automobile FIA, had engaged in sexual acts with five prostitutes. While Mosley denied the allegations, he cancelled his scheduled appearance at the Bahrain Grand Prix. Several teams condemned Mosley s alleged actions and asked for his resignation, and while for a time the controversy threatened to overshadow the race, Mosley eventually retained his position and successfully sued the News of the World for the report. The qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into three parts. The first part ran for minutes, and cars that finished the session th position or lower were eliminated from qualifying. The second part of the qualifying session lasted minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions to. The final part of the qualifying session determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which failed to make the final session could refuel before the race, so ran lighter in those sessions. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions. The weather and conditions on the grid were before dry for the race. The air temperature was C F with signs of a breeze which could blow sand onto the track and impede the cars grip. Massa got the best start of the frontrunners off the line, as he passed Kubica into the first corner to take the lead. Hamilton s poor start caused his anti stall system to kick in, and he was passed by six drivers to fall back to ninth. Rikknen benefited from Hamilton s start by moving up to third, ahead of Kovalainen, Trulli and Heidfeld. As Massa extended his lead at the front of the race, Hamilton, who trailed Alonso, collided with the back of the Renault, knocking the McLaren s front wing off the car. Suffering handling difficulties, Hamilton returned to the pit lane for a new nose section, and rejoined in th place. Rikknen took second place when he passed Kubica on lap three Heidfeld took fourth when he passed Trulli and Kovalainen in separate manoeuvres. Further down the field, Vettel retired from the race on the first lap after twice colliding with other cars Button, Sutil and Coulthard pitted to repair early damage. By lap, Massa had opened his lead over Rikknen to. seconds, ahead of Kubica, Heidfeld, Kovalainen and Trulli. Kubica was the first of the frontrunners to pit, on lap.

Note Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings. The couple, depicted in the centre, are accompanied by a host of divinities and other celestial beings. The god Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi are often pictured as giving away the bride to Shiva. The god Brahma is shown as the officiating priest. The Kalyanasundara icon is not the object of popular worship and is usually used only in the celebrations of the divine marriage in annual temple festivals. However, Kalyanasundara scenes are found across India in caves, sculptures and on temple walls. SS El Sol was one of four sister ships that carried cargo and a limited number of passengers for the Morgan Line. She was acquired by the U.S. Army after the United States entered World War I in April, and converted to carry horses and mules to France. In August, the ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy and continued transporting animals through the end of the war. El Sol returned to the Morgan Line in and sailed with them until March, when she sank in New York Harbor after colliding with Sac City of the American Diamond Line. A portion of the ship s cargo was salvaged but the ship was scrapped later in the year. Hoover Dam, once known as Boulder Dam, is a concrete arch gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on the border between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between and during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was controversially named after President Herbert Hoover. As the technology of electric power transmission improved, the Lower Colorado was considered for its hydroelectric power potential. In, the Edison Electric Company of Los Angeles surveyed the river in the hope of building a foot m rock dam which could generate, horsepower, kW. However, at the time, the limit of transmission of electric power was miles km, and there were few customers mostly mines within that limit. Edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapse including an option for what became the site of Hoover Dam. In the following years, the Bureau of Reclamation BOR, known as the Reclamation Service at the time, also considered the Lower Colorado as the site for a dam. Service chief Arthur Powell Davis proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of Boulder Canyon, miles km north of the eventual dam site, into the river. The river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris, and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble. In, after considering it for several years, the Reclamation Service finally rejected the proposal, citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money. On January, the Bureau made the bid documents available to interested parties, at five dollars a copy. The government was to provide the materials but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam. The dam was described in minute detail, covering pages of text and drawings. A million bid bond was to accompany each bid the winner would have to post a million performance bond. The contractor had seven years to build the dam, or penalties would ensue. Before the dam could be built, the Colorado River needed to be diverted away from the construction site. To accomplish this, four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls, two on the Nevada side and two on the Arizona side. These tunnels were ft m in diameter. Their combined length was nearly, ft, or more than miles km. The contract required these tunnels to be completed by October, with a, per day fine to be assessed for any delay. To meet the deadline, Six Companies had to complete work by early, since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert. To protect the construction site from the Colorado River and to facilitate the river s diversion, two cofferdams were constructed. Work on the upper cofferdam began in September, even though the river had not yet been diverted. The cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work, and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself. The upper cofferdam was ft m high, and feet m thick at its base, as thicker than the dam itself. It contained, cubic yards, m of material. With most work finished on the dam itself the powerhouse remained uncompleted, a formal dedication ceremony was arranged for September, to coincide with a western tour being made by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The morning of the dedication, it was moved forward three hours from p.m. Pacific time to a.m. this was done because Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes had reserved a radio slot for the President for p.m. but officials did not realize until the day of the ceremony that the slot was for p.m. Eastern Time. Despite the change in the ceremony time, and temperatures of F C, people were present for the President s speech in which he avoided mentioning the name of former President Hoover, who was not invited to the ceremony. To mark the occasion, a three cent stamp was issued by the United States Post Office Department bearing the name Boulder Dam, the official name of the dam between and. After the ceremony, Roosevelt made the first visit by any American president to Las Vegas. Not included in the official fatalities number were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning, brought on by the use of gasoline fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels, and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims. The site s diversion tunnels frequently reached F C, enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases. A total of workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period. Prior to Abby s landfall in Texas, gale warnings were issued for the coast and residents on Matagorda Island were evacuated. Overall, the storm s impacts were limited due to its small size. Only two structures sustained damage in Matagorda, one being destroyed by a possible tornado, and the remaining effects resulted from flooding in Jackson and Victoria Counties. Total damage from the storm was estimated at, with the majority stemming from crops. Abby s small size resulted in its effects being limited to areas within the immediate track. Sustained winds of mph km h with gusts to mph km h were measured by the Army Corps of Engineers in Matagorda. Near the town, a possible tornado unroofed a barn and tossed the structure ft m this building previously had withstood the effects of Hurricane Carla in. Winds estimated at mph km h tore part of the roof off a fishing warehouse in Matagorda itself. Along the coast, tides ranged from to ft. to. m above normal from Matagorda to Freeport. Four men and five dogs required rescue after their vessel became stranded on the Colorado River. During the Bush War, the Rhodesian Army augmented its ranks with foreign volunteers, who were accepted into regular regiments with the same pay and conditions of service as locals. Most foreign recruits enlisted in the Rhodesian Light Infantry RLI, which launched an overseas recruitment programme in, but required successful applicants to speak good English. The Army attempted to alleviate the strain on its troops during late by recruiting French speakers as well, and formed a designated company in the Rhodesia Regiment for them. The regiment already had six independent companies, so the francophone unit became Independent Company. The first dent to morale came after about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army. In the eyes of some of the French speaking soldiers, the ranks assigned appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors, and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company s soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet. As Chen was born in a culture other than the culture he now lives in, he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people. His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire emotional responses in the player that other games are lacking. Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer. After Flower was released to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany moved on to their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen to focus on the element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey was released on the PlayStation Network on March, and has received critical acclaim. Ernest William Hornung June March was an English author and poet known for writing the A. J. Raffles series of stories about a gentleman thief in late th century London. Hornung was educated at Uppingham School as a result of poor health he left the school in December to travel to Sydney, where he stayed for two years. He drew on his Australian experiences as a background when he began writing, initially short stories and later novels. In he wrote In the Chains of Crime, which introduced Raffles and his sidekick, Bunny Manders the characters were based partly on his friends Oscar Wilde and his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, and also on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The series of Raffles short stories were collected for sale in book form in, and two further books of Raffles short stories followed, as well as a poorly received novel. Aside from his Raffles stories, Hornung was a prodigious writer of fiction, publishing numerous books from, with A Bride from the Bush to his novel The Crime Doctor. Waymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied despite a well received audition. Simone became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to her race, a statement that has been a matter of controversy. Years later, two days before her death, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed an honorary degree on Simone. To make a living, Eunice Waymon changed her name to Nina Simone. The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play the devil s music or cocktail piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. Simone recorded more than forty albums, mostly between, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue, and, and had a hit in the United States in with I Loves You, Porgy. After the success of Little Girl Blue, Simone signed a contract with Colpix Records and recorded a multitude of studio and live albums. Colpix relinquished all creative control to her, including the choice of material that would be recorded, in exchange for her signing the contract with them. After the release of her live album Nina Simone at Town Hall, Simone became a favorite performer in Greenwich Village. By this time, Simone performed pop music only to make money to continue her classical music studies and was indifferent about having a recording contract. She kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career. Simone published her autobiography, I Put a Spell on You, in. She recorded her last album, A Single Woman in, where she depicted herself as such single woman. This album reflected her solitude and pain. She continued to tour through the s but rarely traveled without an entourage. During the last decade of her life, Simone had sold more than one million records making her a global catalog best seller. This was accompanied by the CD revolution, global exposure through media television and the novelty of the Internet. Two days before her death, Simone was awarded an honorary degree by the Curtis Institute of Music, the music school that had refused to admit her as a student at the beginning of her career. Simone was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in. In, a statue in her honor was erected in Trade Street in her native Tryon, North Carolina.

His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.

The residence of the United States Ambassador to the United Nations is the official residence of the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. As of it was located in a suite of rooms on the nd floor of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City leased by the U.S. Department of State. Described in press reports as palatial, the establishment of the current residence in marked the first time in history that an ambassadorial residence had been located in a hotel. As of, the State Department was paying, per year to lease the suite on a rolling basis the lease is renewed every ten years with an optional one or two year short term extension. In, it was announced the State Department would no longer permit staff to be housed at the Waldorf Astoria, due to security concerns arising from the recent purchase of the property by Chinese business interests. Whether the decision would impact the status of the residence was not made clear, however, as of March the hotel was still being occupied by the U.S. ambassador. The route is maintained by the Kansas Department of Transportation KDOT, who is responsible for constructing and maintaining highways in the state. As part of this role, KDOT regularly surveys traffic on their highways. These surveys are most often presented in the form of annual average daily traffic, which is the number of vehicles that use a highway during an average day of the year. In, KDOT calculated that a total of vehicles used the road daily, including trucks. No part of the highway has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation s defence, mobility, and economy. The entire route is in Washington County. Tropical Storm Jose was a short lived tropical storm which made landfall in central Mexico during August. Jose was the tenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the fourth of six tropical cyclones three hurricanes and three tropical storms to make landfall in Mexico in that year. Situated over very warm waters and within an area of low wind shear, the depression was able to quickly organize however, due to its proximity to land, the NHC noted, the system does not have very long... to take advantage of these favorable conditions. Located to the south of a mid level ridge, the depression tracked just north of due west and kept this motion through the remainder of its existence. The depression rapidly intensified as it moved to the west, becoming Tropical Storm Jose just six hours later. The global model guidance initially failed to resolve the storm s track well, with some models indicating that it would stall offshore. Jose continued to strengthen as it moved towards the coast and made landfall in the state of Veracruz early on August with winds reaching a peak of mph km h. As Jose made its landfall an eye was beginning to form, although the storm was still well short of hurricane intensity. Tropical Storm Jose quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated that afternoon in the mountains of central Mexico only hours after forming. As Tropical Storm Jose formed so close to shore there was a lead time of less than hours on the tropical storm warning for the Veracruz coastline. The area covered by the warning issued on August was extended southwards as Jose intensified, before being canceled soon after landfall on August. The advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center emphasized that rainfall from Jose was the primary threat. The Actor s Children is a American silent short drama written by Lloyd Lonergan and produced by the Thanhouser Company in New Rochelle, New York.

HBO described its marketing strategy as its largest, most aggressive for a new series, and media outlets estimated its cost at million. On its first broadcast, an estimated. million US viewers watched the episode. On its first airing in the UK and Ireland, it secured an estimated audience of. million people. Critical reception was largely mixed, with several reviewers writing that the episode suffered from slow storytelling. The Stolen Eagle garnered four major awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects and the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing Drama Series. David Baldwin, the executive vice president of program planning, said, This is a huge series for us. We wanted to give it every opportunity to be seen by as many people as possible. Media outlets estimated that the entire marketing campaign cost HBO million, the most the network had spent on marketing a series to that point. Some viewers criticized the graphic nudity seen in the pilot, especially in the US. Heller commented, Romans didn t have our body shame and fear of sexuality. I think that is part of the modern fascination with that world. There was a lack of shame about those things, that we had to portray with a lack of shame in order to make it work. Since his first cameo in the series, director Tetsuya Nomura has stated that Roxas is an important character to the series, and that in order to explain his back story in more detail than done in Kingdom Hearts II, Kingdom Hearts Days was created. Since his introduction in Kingdom Hearts II, Roxas has received positive critical response from video game publications with most of them focusing on his development in Days. Various types of merchandising have been released based on his character. Due to his resemblance with Ventus, video game publications initially thought that Roxas would be one of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications still discussed how similar they were and if there was a connection between them. Back to Tennessee is a country rock song by American singer songwriter and actor Billy Ray Cyrus. It released as the second single from Cyrus eleventh studio album of the same name on February, by Lyric Street Records. Cyrus drafted the song after learning that Hannah Montana The Movie, a film he would star in, would be set in Tennessee. The song, developed with the aid of co songwriters Tamara Dunn and Matthew Wilder, includes country rock elements while describing Cyrus longing to return to the South, where he grew up, after spending several years in Los Angeles. Back to Tennessee was featured in both Hannah Montana The Movie and its soundtrack. Cyrus recorded Back to Tennessee for the film Hannah Montana The Movie, in which his character performs the song at a fundraiser to save the meadows near his hometown from development. Cyrus says the song is part of the cornerstone of the film because it reflects the film s theme of escaping the fast paced, glitzy world of Hollywood in search of a simpler country lifestyle. Cyrus commented, When I see the video for Back to Tennessee, there s a lot of emotion there. It s a combination between the Hannah Montana movie and going back to the actual spot where I wrote the song. I wrote the song in Malibu, and we went back to Malibu to film the video. I had never done a video exactly where I wrote the song. Then we take my little blue truck from the movie and travel back across the country. Again, it becomes a very articulate picture of what that song s about. It s everything a video is supposed to be. The entire highway was on the Emmet Cheboygan county line. Various segments of maps are scattered around the galleon, which will form a complete view of the game s overworld once all the segments are picked up. Other scattered items in the game include keys for locked doors, gunpowder to fire cannons and pieces of jewellery, the latter having no additional use other than adding to the player s score. After growing up in North Carolina and fighting in World War II, Wilhelm spent several years in the minor leagues before starting his MLB career. He was best known for his knuckleball, which enabled him to have great longevity. He appeared occasionally as a starting pitcher, but he pitched mainly as a specialist relief man, a role in which he won games, still the record for relief pitchers. He was the first pitcher to reach saves and the first to appear in, games. Wilhelm, who did not enter the major leagues until his late twenties, pitched until he was nearly years old. Wilhelm retired with one of the lowest career earned run averages in baseball history. After retiring as a player in the early s, he held coaching roles with the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves for many years. He was a longtime resident of Sarasota, Florida, where he died in a nursing home of heart failure in. He returned to the Moors in, following his military service. Over the and seasons, Wilhelm earned wins with Mooresville. He later recalled being dropped from a Class D minor league team and having the manager tell him to forget about the knuckleball, but he persisted with it. The Boston Braves purchased Wilhelm from Mooresville in. On November, Wilhelm was drafted by the New York Giants from the Braves in the minor league draft. Wilhelm made his MLB debut with the Giants on April, at age, giving up a hit and two walks while only recording one out. On April, in his second game with the New York Giants, Wilhelm batted for the first time in the majors. Facing rookie Dick Hoover of the Boston Braves, Wilhelm hit a home run over the short right field fence at the Polo Grounds. Although he went to bat a total of times in his career, he never hit another home run. In, Wilhelm finished with career highs in both saves and games pitched. His ERA decreased to. that season it remained less than. through the season. In, Wilhelm contributed to another passed balls record when Chicago catcher J. C. Martin allowed of them in one season. That total set a modern single season baseball record for the category. Wilhelm s career low ERA. came in, when he earned an record for the White Sox with saves. Wilhelm was released by the Braves on June, having pitched in three games for that year s Braves. He signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers on July,. He appeared in nine MLB games for the Dodgers, giving up two earned runs in innings. He also pitched in eight games that season for the team s Class AAA minor league affiliate, the Spokane Indians. He started six of those games and registered a. ERA. He pitched in games for the Dodgers in, registering a. ERA over innings. The Dodgers released him on July,. He never appeared in another game. Wilhelm was on the ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame for eight years before he was elected. After Wilhelm failed to garner enough votes for induction in, sportswriter Jim Murray criticized the voters, saying that while Wilhelm never had the look of a baseball player, he was the best player in history at what he does. He fell short by votes in. Wilhelm was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in. At his induction ceremony, he said that he had achieved all three of his initial major league goals appearing in a World Series, being named to an All Star team, and throwing a no hitter. He and his wife Peggy lived in Sarasota, Florida. They raised three children together Patti, Pam, and Jim. Wilhelm died of heart failure in a Sarasota nursing home in. Wilhelm was known as a relief ace and his teams used him in a new way that became a trend. Rather than bringing in a relief pitcher only when the starting pitcher had begun to struggle, teams increasingly called upon their relief pitchers toward the end of any close game. Wilhelm was the first relief pitcher elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Abu Jamal became involved in black nationalism in his youth and was a member of the Black Panther Party until October, after which he became a radio journalist, eventually becoming president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists. On December, Faulkner was fatally shot while conducting a routine traffic stop of Abu Jamal s brother, William Cook. Abu Jamal was found at the scene with a bullet wound from Faulkner s gun and his own discharged revolver beside him. He was arrested and charged with Faulkner s murder. The jury delivered a unanimous guilty verdict after three hours of deliberations. Abu Jamal was subsequently sentenced to death by the unanimous decision of the jury. Judge William H. Yohn Jr. of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania upheld the conviction but vacated the sentence of death on December, citing irregularities in the original process of sentencing. Particularly, On December, the Third Circuit Court admitted four issues for appeal of the ruling of the District Court in relation to sentencing, whether the jury verdict form had been flawed and the judge s instructions to the jury had been confusing in relation to conviction and sentencing, whether racial bias in jury selection existed to an extent tending to produce an inherently biased jury and therefore an unfair trial the Batson claim in relation to post conviction review hearings in, whether the presiding judge, who had also presided at the trial, demonstrated unacceptable bias in his conduct. On December, District Attorney of Philadelphia R. Seth Williams announced that prosecutors, with the support of the victim s family, would no longer seek the death penalty for Abu Jamal. Faulkner had indicated she did not wish to relive the trauma of another trial, and that it would be extremely difficult to present the case against Abu Jamal again, after the passage of years and the deaths of several key witnesses. Williams, the prosecutor, said that Abu Jamal will spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole, a sentence that was reaffirmed by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania on July,. After the press conference, Maureen Faulkner made an emotional statement harshly condemning Abu Jamal In Abu Jamal published an essay in the Yale Law Journal, on the death penalty and his death row experience. In May, Abu Jamal was engaged by National Public Radio s All Things Considered program to deliver a series of monthly three minute commentaries on crime and punishment. The broadcast plans and commercial arrangement were canceled following condemnations from, among others, the Fraternal Order of Police and US Senator Bob Dole Kansas Republican Party. Abu Jamal sued NPR for not airing his work, but a federal judge dismissed the suit. The commentaries later appeared in print in May as part of Live from Death Row. Labor unions, politicians, advocates, educators, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and human rights advocacy organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have expressed concern about the impartiality of the trial of Abu Jamal, though Amnesty International neither takes a position on the guilt or innocence of Abu Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner. They are opposed by the family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, Republican politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police. In August, the Fraternal Order of Police called for an economic boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Abu Jamal. Abu Jamal has been made an honorary citizen of about cities around the world, including Montreal, Palermo, and Paris. Brandon Ricardo Minor born July, is a former American football running back.

In, the centenary of Olivier s birth, a life sized statue of him was unveiled on the South Bank, outside the National Theatre the same year the BFI held a retrospective season of his film work. After Olivier s death, Gielgud reflected, He followed in the theatrical tradition of Kean and Irving. He respected tradition in the theatre, but he also took great delight in breaking tradition, which is what made him so unique. He was gifted, brilliant, and one of the great controversial figures of our time in theatre, which is a virtue and not a vice at all. Credits are taken from B Day liner notes. Vocals Beyonc Knowles Mixing Jason Goldstein Rich Harrison The class comprised three ships Derfflinger, Ltzow, and Hindenburg. All three of the ships saw active service with the High Seas Fleet during World War I. Derfflinger was commissioned shortly after the outbreak of war, and was present at most of the naval actions in the North Sea, including the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland. Ltzow was commissioned in August, and only participated in the raid on Yarmouth before being sunk at Jutland. Hindenburg was commissioned into the fleet in May, and saw no major action. Derfflinger and Hindenburg were interned at Scapa Flow following the armistice in November. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, who was in command of the interned High Seas Fleet, ordered the ships to be scuttled in an attempt to prevent their possible seizure by the Royal Navy. The forward conning tower was protected with heavy armor the sides were mm thick and the roof was mm. in thick. The rear conning tower was less well armored its sides were only mm. in thick and the roof was covered with mm. in of armor plate. The main battery gun turrets were also heavily armored the turret sides were mm in thick and the roofs were mm. in thick. On Hindenburg, the thickness of the turret roofs was increased to mm. in. The cm guns had mm worth of armor plating in the casemates the guns themselves had mm. in thick shields to protect their crews from shell splinters. At the Battle of Jutland, she was the first ship in the German line, and Hipper s flagship, and drew fire from the British battlecruisers which included hits below her waterline. Shortly after the start of the battlecruiser action, Ltzow hit her opponent Lion several times one hit knocked out Lion s Q turret, and the resulting magazine fire nearly destroyed the ship. Shortly after, the armored cruisers Defence and Warrior inadvertently ran into the German line Ltzow opened fire immediately, followed by several German dreadnoughts. In a hail of shells, Defence s ammunition magazines detonated and the ship was sunk. At around the same time, the fresh battlecruisers of the rd Battlecruiser Squadron engaged their German opposites. Between and, Ltzow sustained four inch shell hits in her bow from the British battlecruisers these eventually proved to be fatal. Despite this, at, the combined fire of Ltzow and her sister Derfflinger destroyed the battlecruiser Invincible. By, Ltzow had been hit five more times, including hits on her two forward turrets. Hindenburg was the last battlecruiser completed for the Imperial German Navy, and as such had a very short career. She was commissioned May, and was fully operational by October, too late to see any major action in World War I. On November Hindenburg and Moltke, along with the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group, were acting as distant support for German minesweepers off the German coast when they were attacked by British battlecruisers. The raid was brief by the time Hindenburg and Moltke arrived on the scene, the British ships had broken off the attack and withdrawn. Six days later, Hindenburg replaced Seydlitz as flagship of the I Scouting Group. On April, the ship took part in an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea that attempted to intercept an Allied convoy. Moltke sustained mechanical damage while en route, and as a result, Vice Admiral Hipper decided to cancel the operation. On August, Hipper was promoted to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced Hipper as the commander of the I Scouting Group he raised his flag on Hindenburg the following day. Hindenburg was interned at Scapa Flow, along with her sister Derfflinger and the rest of the German battlecruisers. She was scuttled on June, and sank at. Several unsuccessful attempts to raise her were made on July the ship was finally raised. From to she was scrapped at Rosyth. Her bell was presented to the German Federal Navy on May. The ships had a median displacement of, long tons, t, were just over feet m in length, and had a beam of about feet. m. All of the ships had two direct drive steam turbines and a combination of other engines for cruising at speeds less than knots km h. All of the ships were designed for a maximum speed of knots km h. As built, they were armed with four inch mm guns and had four twin inch torpedo tubes with a load of eight torpedoes, but all were later equipped with depth charges. The ships were built by four private American shipyards Bath Iron Works, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, New York Shipbuilding Corporation, and William Cramp and Sons and were laid down between September and November launched between April and February and commissioned into the U.S. Navy between June and August. All six ships operated in the Atlantic or Caribbean until the U.S. entrance into World War I in April, when all six were sent overseas to Queenstown, Ireland, for convoy escort duties. Several of the ships rescued passengers and crew from ships sunk by U boats, and several had encounters with U boats themselves Nicholson helped sink U in November, the first U boat sunk by the U.S. Navy. All six members of the class had returned to the United States in January and were decommissioned by June. In, two of the six Ericsson and McDougal were commissioned into the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the Rum Patrol. They were returned to U.S. Navy custody in and, respectively. All six ships had been sold for scrapping by June. The main battery of the O Brien class consisted of four inch mm Mark guns, with each gun weighing in excess of, pounds, kg. The guns fired pound kg armor piercing projectiles at, feet per second m s. At an elevation of, the guns had a range of, yards, m. All six members of the class served in the Atlantic or Caribbean throughout their U.S. Navy careers. In October, with the United States still neutral in World War I, five of the six class members all except Nicholson were among the U.S. destroyers sent out to rescue survivors from five ships torpedoed by German submarine U off the Lightship Nantucket. After the United States entered the war in April, all six class members were sent overseas to Queenstown, Ireland, for convoy escort and anti submarine duties. McDougal was in the first group of six American destroyers that arrived at Queenstown on May Ericsson and Winslow followed in the second group, which arrived thirteen days later, and Cushing, Nicholson, and O Brien in the third group, a week after that. Several of the ships had encounters with U boats during the war Nicholson, working with Fanning in November, helped to sink U, which was the first U boat sunk by the U.S. Navy earlier, in June, O Brien had depth charged U and was thought by the British Admiralty to have seriously damaged the U boat, but post war analysis of records showed that U survived the attack and returned safely to port. All six ships returned to the United States in January and served in various roles over the next two years. Cushing was decommissioned in August, followed by Nicholson and McDougal in May, and the remaining three in the following month. In June, two of the six ships Ericsson and McDougal were reactivated for service with the United States Coast Guard s Rum Patrol. Ericsson was returned to the U.S. Navy in May, and McDougal in June both were sold for scrapping in. O Brien was sold for scrapping in, and the remaining three in June.

We ll Always Have Paris is the th episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek The Next Generation, first aired on May, in broadcast syndication. The story and script were both created by Deborah Dean Davis and Hannah Louise Shearer, and the episode was directed by Robert Becker. The story was originally pitched by Hannah Louise Shearer and Deborah Dean Davis, who were also given the job of developing the script. The writing of the episode suffered from the timing of the Writers Guild of America strike, with Shearer and Dean Davis completing the script in five days. The premise of the story was a combination of their idea of a story about a professor whose work wasn t appreciated and had to go off on his own and that of Maurice Hurley who wanted a story with a time anomaly. The final draft was dated February and featured numerous differences from the filmed version, including Jenice being called Laura, a number of different interactions for the crew, and Riker, Worf and Data all being involved in shutting down Manheim s equipment. The script was finalised a week before the episode was filmed, but the writers strike caused further issues when it was discovered during filming that the scene where Data was to fix the time distortions hadn t been completed. We ll Always Have Paris aired in broadcast syndication during the week commencing May,. It received Nielsen ratings of., reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot. This was the same ratings received as the previous episode, Skin of Evil. The first home media release of We ll Always Have Paris was on VHS cassette was on July, in the United States and Canada. The episode was later included on the Star Trek The Next Generation season one DVD box set, released in March, and was released as part of the season one Blu ray set on July,. Burn injuries occur more commonly among the poor. Smoking is a risk factor, although alcohol use is not. Fire related burns are generally more common in colder climates. Specific risk factors in the developing world include cooking with open fires or on the floor as well as developmental disabilities in children and chronic diseases in adults. To determine the need for referral to a specialized burn unit, the American Burn Association devised a classification system. Under this system, burns can be classified as major, moderate and minor. This is assessed based on a number of factors, including total body surface area affected, the involvement of specific anatomical zones, the age of the person, and associated injuries. Minor burns can typically be managed at home, moderate burns are often managed in hospital, and major burns are managed by a burn center. In the developed world, adult males have twice the mortality as females from burns. This is most probably due to their higher risk occupations and greater risk taking activities. In many countries in the developing world, however, females have twice the risk of males. This is often related to accidents in the kitchen or domestic violence. In children, deaths from burns occur at more than ten times the rate in the developing than the developed world. Overall, in children it is one of the top fifteen leading causes of death. From the s to, many countries have seen both a decrease in the rates of fatal burns and in burns generally. An estimated, burn injuries receive medical treatment yearly in the United States. They resulted in about, deaths in. Most burns and deaths from burns occur in males. The highest incidence of fire burns occurs in those years old, while the highest incidence of scalds occurs in children less than five years old and adults over. Electrical burns result in about, deaths per year. Lightning results in the death of about people a year. In Europe, intentional burns occur most commonly in middle aged men. Tropical Storm Brenda was the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. It developed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on July, and after moving ashore over the Florida Peninsula, it attained tropical storm status. Brenda accelerated northeast along the U.S. East Coast, ultimately peaking as a moderate storm with winds of mph km h before crossing the Mid Atlantic states and New England it dissipated on July over southern Canada. The storm inflicted moderate damage in Florida, the worst since Hurricane Easy of, and dropped heavy rainfall as far north as New York City. Total damage is estimated at US million, and only indirect deaths are blamed on the cyclone. A weak low pressure area that organized in the northeast Gulf of Mexico began to intensify on July, while located west of the Tampa Bay. Early in its life, the system had a broad circulation with primarily light winds, similar to that of a subtropical storm. The storm is estimated to have become a tropical depression earlier the previous day as it moved toward the northeast. It made landfall along the Florida coast near Cross City and continued inland, gradually accelerating. It likely attained tropical storm status at around UTC on July while its center was situated west of Tampa. The cyclone was named Brenda after reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that it had reached tropical storm strength. At around UTC on July, Brenda moved into Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, it lost its tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. It dissipated by August over southern Canada. Because Brenda was in the vicinity of land for most of its course, it was not able to intensify beyond tropical storm status. In advance of the storm, tropical storm advisories and wind warnings were issued from Florida to Maine. Rainfall from Tropical Storm Brenda affected at least states. The heaviest precipitation fell in western Florida near Tampa, east of the storm s center the Tampa International Airport recorded. in mm of rainfall. Extensive flooding occurred in the west central Florida Peninsula. Wind gusts exceeded mph km h, and the storm produced ft. m high waves along the coast, leading to considerable erosion. However, storm tides were not severe. Around the Naples area, Brenda s effects were primarily light, although small boat and dock facilities and roads sustained some damage. A private seawall at Clearwater was breached in two places by the cyclone. Tides along the Outer Banks of North Carolina were generally reported at ft. m above normal. In and around Wilmington, the storm caused minor damage to roofs and windows of some beachfront structures. Power was temporarily interrupted due to fallen tree limbs. Heavy rainfall caused flooding on streams and rivers, and in some areas the precipitation helped to end a serious drought. Some boats were swamped, and the winds ripped the roof off a cottage at Long Beach. The heavy rain and high tides flooded tobacco fields.

The Hawaii football team normally receives an automatic bid to the game unless the team is selected to participate in a BCS game or is not bowl eligible. If either of those events happen, the WAC selects its next highest ranked team to compete in the game. In, Hawaii was selected to play on January, in the Sugar Bowl against Georgia, marking just the second time since the creation of the Hawaii Bowl that Hawaii would not participate. The only previous time that Hawaii failed to make an appearance was in, when the Warriors finished their season with a record and were not eligible for a bowl game. Boise State was undefeated in conference play going into the final game of the regular season, and suffered just one out of conference loss. In that final game, BSU lost to undefeated Hawaii. Following the game, the Broncos decided to travel to Hawaii, rather than play at home in the Humanitarian Bowl, which is located at Boise s home stadium in Boise, Idaho and features a matchup between a WAC team and one from the Atlantic Coast Conference. Boise ended its regular season overall and in conference play. East Carolina won the pre game coin toss and deferred the ball until the second half, allowing Boise State to receive the ball to begin the game.

On Boise s second play of the new drive following the punt, the team earned its first first down of the game. The Broncos continued the drive by going yards in eight plays, culminating in a touchdown. The series included five complete passes and two rushes. With the score, The Broncos had closed the gap to ten points East Carolina. East Carolina started their series on their yard line.

South of the Rio Grande, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources IUCN lists the cat in every Central and South American country. While specific state and provincial statistics are often available in North America, much less is known about the cat in its southern range. The cougar s total breeding population is estimated at less than, by the IUCN, with a declining trend. US state level statistics are often more optimistic, suggesting cougar populations have rebounded. In Oregon, a healthy population of, was reported in, exceeding a target of,. California has actively sought to protect the cat and a similar number of cougars has been suggested, between, and,. With the increase of human development and infrastructure growth in California, the North American Cougar populations are becoming more isolated from one another. The gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey, especially in winter. Wolves can steal kills and occasionally kill the cat. One report describes a large pack of to wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens. Conversely, lone female or young wolves are vulnerable to predation, and have been reported ambushed and killed by cougars. Various accounts of cougars killing lone wolves, including a six year old female, have also been documented. Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities, and disrupting the feline s behavior. Preliminary research in Yellowstone, for instance, has shown displacement of the cougar by wolves. In nearby Sun Valley, Idaho, a cougar wolf encounter that resulted in the death of the cougar was documented. One researcher in Oregon noted When there is a pack around, cougars are not comfortable around their kills or raising kittens... A lot of times a big cougar will kill a wolf, but the pack phenomenon changes the table. This uncertainty has been recognized by Canadian authorities. The Canadian federal agency called Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada rates its current data as insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the eastern cougar s survival, and says on its Web site Despite many sightings in the past two decades from eastern Canada, there are insufficient data to evaluate the taxonomy or assign a status to this cougar. Notwithstanding numerous reported sightings in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, it has been said that the evidence is inconclusive... there may not be a distinct eastern subspecies, and some sightings may be of escaped pets. On March, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service declared the Eastern cougar Puma concolor couguar officially extinct. New York State Route NY is a short state highway located entirely in the town of Patterson in northeastern Putnam County, New York, in the United States.

The Sorraia is a rare breed of horse indigenous to the portion of the Iberian peninsula, in the Sorraia River basin, in Portugal. The Sorraia is known for its primitive features, including a convex profile and dun coloring with primitive markings. Concerning its origins, a theory has been advanced by some authors that the Sorraia is a descendant of primitive horses belonging to the naturally occurring wild fauna of Southern Iberia. Studies are currently ongoing to discover the relationship between the Sorraia and various wild horse types, as well as its relationship with other breeds from the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa. On adult horses, the lay of the hair can create the appearance of stripes or barring on the neck and chest. Also due to the lay of the hair, newborn foals can appear to have stripes all over, reminiscent of zebra stripes. The breed standard refers to this as hair stroke.

NY, named Bridge Road, passes through Crown Point State Historic Site and runs the entire length of Crown Point, a peninsula protruding into Lake Champlain. NY was assigned on April, as a signed replacement for New York State Route L, an unsigned reference route. It is the third signed designation that Bridge Road has carried, preceded by New York State Route during the early s and NY s to the s. NY originally connected to the Champlain Bridge on its east end however, that structure was closed and demolished in late. Its replacement opened to traffic in November. NY begins at an intersection with NY N and NY in Crown Point. The route progresses eastward as a two lane highway named Bridge Road. Heading away from the western terminus, there is a fork in the road to the left is NY, and to the right is a road to a housing development. Most of NY runs along the lowlands around Lake Champlain, making curves at intersections, and heading on relatively flat elevations. As the highway approaches the lake, it makes a curve to the north. There, it intersects with County Route Lake Road and begins to follow the lake shore. NY was truncated south to Hague c., eliminating a lengthy overlap with NY and NY N. Its former routing along Bridge Road became NY, an unsigned reference route. The NY designation was later replaced with NY L when a new numbering system for reference routes was adopted by the New York State Department of Transportation, and NY L itself was redesignated and signed as NY on April,. On October, the Champlain Bridge was closed to traffic due to structural concerns. The bridge was demolished on December, as a result of those concerns, temporarily reducing NY in purpose to a spur route linking NY N and NY to Crown Point.

Dota is played in matches between two five player teams, each of which occupies a base in a corner of the playing field. Each player controls one of playable characters, called heroes, that feature unique abilities and styles of play. During a match, the player collects gold, items, and experience points for their hero, while fighting heroes of the opposite team. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other side s Ancient building, located within the opposing base. Development of Dota began in when IceFrog, lead designer of the original Defense of the Ancients mod, was hired by Valve for the same role. Dota initially used the original Source game engine until it was ported over to Source in September, making it the first game to use it. The game also allows for the community to create custom game modes, maps, and cosmetics for the heroes, which are then uploaded to the Steam Workshop. The popularity of Dota has led to official merchandise being produced for it, including apparel, accessories, toys, and promotional tie ins to other games and media. Valve s interest in the Defense of the Ancients property began when several veteran employees, including Team Fortress designer Robin Walker, became fans of the mod and attempted to play it competitively.

Recorded dietary items include sago shoots and insects, and it also swallows small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently monogamous, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour. The only known nest was a shallow bowl in the top of a rotting tree stump that was lined with wood chips and dry leaves. The two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails. The estimated population of, birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN. Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to rice cultivation, and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought. The rails are a large and very widespread family, with nearly species. They are small to medium sized, terrestrial or wetland birds, and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation. Island species readily become flightless of extant or recently extinct taxa restricted to islands, have lost the ability to fly.

He made his Major League Baseball debut, incidentally his only game, with the New York Yankees in, and had a record a. earned run average ERA, and two strikeouts in that game. Born in West Germany, Wever moved to the United States as a child, where he took up baseball. He played baseball in high school and the University of California, Santa Barbara, which led to him being drafted by the New York Yankees. After four seasons in the minor leagues, Wever made his major league debut on September. In his debut, he suffered a shoulder injury, which he tried to pitch through for two years before having surgery in. He tried to come back from the injury in, but retired. After retiring, he opened a bar in San Francisco, which he continues to run. In, Wever began the season remaining with Fort Lauderdale. He had a record and a. ERA in games before being promoted to the Nashville Sounds of the Southern League, the Yankees AA affiliate. With Nashville, he had a record and. ERA in nine appearances. Wever s pitching coach in Nashville was Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm. Wilhelm felt he had the ability but not the confidence to pitch in the majors, and spent his time in Nashville working on that aspect of Wever s game. The following season, Weber was almost unanimously named to the Southern League All Star team, thanks to wins and strikeouts through the end of June. He improved to a record, a. ERA, and strikeouts, won the Southern League Pitcher of the Year award, and accomplished the pitcher s Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. He led Nashville to the Southern League championship, and right after doing so, the Yankees called Weber up to the major leagues. After retiring from baseball, Wever returned to school, and earned a bachelor s degree in English literature from the University of California, Berkeley. He married Melinda in, and three years later opened up the Horseshoe Tavern, a bar in San Francisco s Marina District, which he continues to run. Djedkare Isesi known in Greek as Tanchers was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the eighth and penultimate ruler of the Fifth Dynasty in the late th century to mid th century BCE, during the Old Kingdom period. Djedkare succeeded Menkauhor Kaiu and was in turn succeeded by Unas. His relations to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain, although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkare s son owing to the smooth transition between the two. The relative chronological position of Djedkare Isesi as the eighth and penultimate ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, succeeding Menkauhor Kaiu and preceding Unas on the throne, is well established by historical sources and confirmed by archaeological evidence. Djedkare may have left some of his monuments unfinished at his death, as suggested by several relief bearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in the pyramid of king Unas. Their original setting remains unknown. Djedkare probably also exploited gold mines in the Eastern Desert and in Nubia indeed, the earliest mention of the land of gold an Ancient Egyptian term for Nubia is found in an inscription from the mortuary temple of Djedkare Isesi. The reforms of Djedkare Isesi played an important role in flourishing of the arts during the later Old Kingdom, as artisans and craftsmen could now find many wealthy patrons beyond the king. This created a surge in the number of commissions leading to a general improvement of the artistic works. This also provided the artisans with a new wealth, which they used to build their own large funerary complexes. More generally, an historical or literary tradition concerning events in the time of Djedkare seems to have flourished toward the end of Old Kingdom as can be inferred from the tombs of Harkuf and Iny. These two officials were in charge of expeditions to foreign lands Punt and Byblos under Merenre I and Pepi II and both relate similar expeditions that took place during the time of Djedkare Isesi. DE was originally designated along Foulk Road in the s. In the s, most of the route was widened into a four lane road. The southern terminus at US was reconstructed into an interchange in the s. PA was first designated in along Foulk Road between the Delaware border and PA and PA in Chelsea. The route was extended north along Valley Brook Road to US in Chester Heights by. The northern terminus of PA was moved to its current location by. DE has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of, vehicles at the Silverside Road intersection to a low of, vehicles at the Pennsylvania border. None of DE is part of the National Highway System. PA has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of, vehicles between the Delaware border and PA to a low of, vehicles between the Bethel Road intersection and US. None of PA is part of the National Highway System. When Pennsylvania first legislated its highways in, what would become PA was legislated as part of Legislative Route between the Delaware border and Chelsea. PA was first designated in to run from the Delaware border to PA Concord Road and PA Chelsea Road in Chelsea, following Foulk Road. By, PA was extended north along Valley Brook Road from US which replaced PA to US in Chester Heights. By, the northern terminus of PA was truncated to its current location at the interchange with US. The aircraft was assigned the airport s runway for the takeoff, but used runway instead. Runway was too short for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun the end of the runway before it could become airborne. It crashed just past the end of the runway, killing all passengers and two of the three crew. The flight s first officer was the only survivor. Although not the pilot in command, according to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying at the time of the accident. In the National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error. All passengers and two of the three crew members on board the flight died. Comair released the passenger manifest on August,. Most of the passengers were US citizens from the Lexington area, ranging in age from to. They included a young couple who had been married the previous day and were traveling to California on their honeymoon. In April, acting on a recommendation made by the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB during its investigation of Comair, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold short line onto the take off runway, and again when initiating takeoff. And in May, acting on another NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take off at night. In April, the NTSB made four further recommendations, three measures to avoid fatigue affecting the performance of air traffic controllers, and one to prevent controllers from carrying out non essential administrative tasks while aircraft are taxiing under their control. Although these recommendations were published during the course of the NTSB s investigation into the accident to Comair Flight, they were in part prompted by four earlier accidents, and the Board was unable to determine whether fatigue contributed to the Comair accident. Runway on Blue Grass Airport was closed on March, and the new foot runway, runway, opened on August,. This runway has been built on a separate location not connected to the runway. Families of of the passengers sued Comair for negligence. Families of the other two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation. Three sample cases were due to be heard on August, but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the compensation payments, are now resolved. The case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October,. In Comair s case against the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining. During a public meeting on July, the NTSB announced the probable cause of the accident, as follows Captain Clay s wife strongly disputes laying primary blame on the pilots, stating that other factors contributed, including an under staffed control tower and an inaccurate runway map. In, a commercial jet at Blue Grass Airport was cleared for takeoff on Runway but mistakenly took Runway instead. Tower personnel noticed the mistake and canceled the aircraft s takeoff clearance just as the crew realized their error. The aircraft subsequently made a safe departure from Runway. Oliver Creek Sunset Creek Fisher Creek Adams Lake and the Lower Adams are fed by The Secwepemc people have lived in the Adams River valley for millennia. A study by the provincial government along the lower river found sixty six sites with evidence of habitation dating to BCE. The abundance of the salmon run made the river an important food source and trade commodity for First Nations people in the region. Although logging continues in the region, the Adams is no longer used for log transport. The Adams River valley supports large populations of mule deer, with smaller herds of white tail deer. Black bears are common in the watershed. The bear population grows substantially during the fall as they gather from adjacent valleys to feed on the spawning salmon. In the upper river valley, moose are common, and the headwaters of the river contain grizzly bear habitat. Several species of aquatic mammals are found on the river, including beaver, mink, and river otter. The holiday is observed throughout India with flag hoisting ceremonies, parades and cultural events. Indians celebrate the day by displaying the national flag on their attire, accessories and homes by listening to patriotic songs, watching patriotic movies and bonding with family and friends.

Kadokawa Shoten collected the stories into a bound volume, and published it on July,. Hurricane Abby was the only tropical cyclone in the Caribbean Sea during the Atlantic hurricane season. The second tropical cyclone and first named storm season, Abby developed on July from a tropical wave in the vicinity of the Lesser Antilles. Abby rapidly intensified into a hurricane after being a tropical storm for less than six hours. It briefly peaked as a category hurricane before weakening back. Abby rapidly weakened to a minimal tropical storm a few days thereafter. The storm re strengthened into a hurricane as it began to parallel the coast of Honduras. Hurricane Abby made landfall in British Honduras present day Belize on July. Abby dissipated over Mexico later the next day. The remnants of Abby ultimately became Hurricane Celeste in the Pacific Ocean. Despite passing through or near several countries, Hurricane Abby had a relatively light impact on land, resulting in just, USD,. million USD in damage and six fatalities. The origins of Hurricane Abby were possibly from a tropical wave that moved in the vicinity of the Lesser Antilles in early July. Ships and a few weather stations on July reported the existence of a tropical cyclone. On July, it had operationally been classified as a tropical storm upon formation, though a later analysis revealed that it was only a tropical depression. The depression passed near Barbados early on July before rapidly intensifying into a hurricane. Hurricane Abby accelerated toward the west and made landfall in St. Lucia as a minimal category hurricane. Abby emerged into the Caribbean Sea a few hours later. As it headed generally westward, it also gradually strengthened. By July, Hurricane Abby had attained peak intensity as a mph km h category hurricane. The intensity of Abby began to gradually level off, though it re intensified slightly in the Caribbean, before eventually weakening further. Abby was downgraded to a tropical storm on the morning of July it was center roughly mi km south of Kingston, Jamaica at the time. Just six hours thereafter, Abby had maximum sustained winds of only mph km h. Abby re intensified at a relatively quick pace, as it was near hurricane status again when it passed just to the north of Honduras on July. Throughout its path, Abby caused only about, USD,. million USD in damage and six fatalities. The schedule was officially released on September,.

Baker s work has achieved cult status in the years since his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published. First edition copies of his earlier works have become collector s items. His novel Testosterone was adapted to a film of the same name, though it was not a financial success. Two other books have been optioned for films, but they have not been produced. Baker s work received mixed reviews. His only two books not specifically gay themed though containing gay characters and a somewhat gay sensibility, Boy Wonder and Fuel Injected Dreams, were better received by critics, and more popular with readers, though he was never a bestselling novelist. Baker himself estimated that his books sold approximately, copies each. His following book, however, Tim and Pete, met with hostile reviews, primarily for its advocacy of political assassination and terror tactics in combating AIDS discrimination. Baker himself was ambivalent on the subject. I think assassination does change things... But I m not really calling for violence, he said. It s a novel, not a position paper. In a interview, however, Baker stated After the reception of Tim and Pete, with several critics calling him The Last Angry Gay Man, Baker faced increasing difficulty finding a publisher for his work and his financial position became precarious. He was only able to publish one novella, Right Wing, and that was self published on the Internet.

USS O Brien Destroyer No. DD was the lead ship of O Brien class destroyers built for the United States Navy prior to the American entry into World War I. The ship was the second US Navy vessel named in honor of Jeremiah O Brien and his five brothers Gideon, John, William, Dennis, and Joseph who, together on the sloop Unity, captured a British warship during the American Revolutionary War. O Brien was laid down by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in September and launched in July. After her May commissioning, O Brien sailed off the east coast and in the Caribbean. She was one of seventeen destroyers sent out to rescue survivors from five victims of German submarine U off the Lightship Nantucket in October. After the United States entered World War I in April, O Brien was sent overseas to patrol the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland. After returning to the United States in January, O Brien revisited European waters in May to serve as one of the picket ships for the NC type seaplanes in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. O Brien was decommissioned at Philadelphia in June. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in March and sold for scrapping in April. O Brien s main battery consisted of four in mm caliber Mark guns, with each gun weighing in excess of, lb, kg. The guns fired lb kg armor piercing projectiles at, ft s m s. At an elevation of, the guns had a range of, yd, m. O Brien was also equipped with four twin in mm torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti aircraft guns for the O Brien class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for O Brien or any of the other ships of the class. Returning from winter maneuvers off Cuba in March, the ship was in the York River when the United States declared war on Germany on April, entering World War I. After fitting out at Brooklyn Navy Yard, she got underway from New York on May with Cummings, Nicholson, Cushing, and Sampson, and joined convoy at Halifax, Nova Scotia, en route to Ireland.

Colin Firth as Tom Birkin Kenneth Branagh as James Moon Natasha Richardson as Alice Keach Jim Carter as Ellerbeck Martin O Neil as Edgar Ellerbeck Richard Vernon as Colonel Hebron David Garth as Old Birkin I felt that if I couldn t do it in the present, suggesting internal pain by performance, then I wouldn t really want to do it at all. To compensate for the lack of budget, a very tight shooting schedule was planned over days, during which Kenneth Branagh was only available for two weeks and was performing on stage nightly in London. Howard Blake recalls I went to a viewing and saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti war theme, but a certain amount of found choral music had already been laid in by the editors... I explained that I loved the film and I thought the choral orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only. Blake decided to compose his score to match the key of the Schubert Mass, in order for the music to continue seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key. The fruit bodies of Hydnellum peckii are found growing solitary, scattered, or clustered together on the ground under conifers, often among mosses and pine needle litter. H. peckii is a late stage fungus that, in boreal forests dominated by jack pine, typically begins associating with more mature hosts once the canopy has closed. A preference for mountainous or subalpine ecosystems has been noted. The fungus has a wide distribution in North America, and is particularly common in the Pacific Northwest its range extends north to Alaska and east to North Carolina. In the Puget Sound area of the U.S. state of Washington, it is found in association with Douglas fir, fir, and hemlock. Along the Oregon Coast it has been collected under lodgepole pine. In addition to North America, the mushroom is widespread in Europe, and its presence has been documented in Italy, Germany, and Scotland. The species is common in the latter location, but becoming increasingly rare in several European countries, such as Norway, The Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. Increased pollution in central Europe has been suggested as one possible factor in the mushroom s decline there. Reports from Iran in and Korea in were the first outside Europe and North America.

Its southern terminus is at an intersection with NY in the town of Owego in Tioga County. The northern terminus is at a junction with NY A in the town of Sterling in Cayuga County. NY is a two lane local road for most of its length. The route is the main access road to parts of Auburn, Dryden, Newark Valley and Port Byron. It passes through mountainous terrain in Tioga and Cortland counties, but the terrain levels out as it heads through the Finger Lakes area and Cayuga County. In the s, the portion of NY between Owego and Freeville was designated as New York State Route while the segment from Freeville to Moravia was the southern part of New York State Route, a highway that continued north from Moravia to Syracuse. NY was assigned as part of the renumbering of state highways in New York, utilizing all of pre NY, the Freeville Moravia portion of NY, and a previously unnumbered highway north to Sterling. Originally, NY extended south into the village of Owego by way of an overlap with NY. It was truncated to its current southern terminus by. The amount of homes along the route begins to increase as NY approaches the village of Newark Valley. Just south of the village limits, NY intersects NY B, a spur leading to NY in Maine. The route continues into the small village as South Main Street and passes by several blocks of homes and commercial buildings. At Water Street, NY becomes North Main Street however, from this point north, most of the village is situated on the opposite bank of Owego Creek. As a result, NY continues through the village limits but passes very few buildings before seamlessly exiting the community and entering another rural area. NY clips the extreme southwestern corner of Cortland County as a result, only. miles. km of the route is located within the county. Just north of the county line, the route meets NY in the hamlet of Harford Mills. NY is little more than an alternate route to NY, which NY meets in the hamlet of Harford. miles. km to the northeast. In between Harford Mills and Harford, the east branch of Owego Creek separates from NY and heads north to follow NY instead. NY continues northwest out of Harford hamlet and into Tompkins County. The overlap between NY and NY ends at the northern village line. At this point, NY continues north while NY forks to the west, running along the village limits on Freeville Road for about mile. km through an area with only a handful of homes. While doing so, the route passes to the south of the Dryden Middle and High School complex. NY heads onward through an open, undeveloped area, curving to the northwest and eventually to the north as it approaches the village of Freeville, where it serves the William George Agency for Children s Services at the southern village line. It remains on Freeville Road until Railroad Street, where it turns west and proceeds into the densely populated village center. Here, it intersects the eastern terminus of NY at a junction situated adjacent to Fall Creek. Cayuga County, located in the Finger Lakes region of New York, has a highly unorthodox shape. Most of the county is only about miles km wide from its western border to its eastern edge. From north to south, however, it extends from Locke north to the Lake Ontario shoreline a distance of about miles km. NY passes through much of the county, ending about miles km south of the shoreline in Sterling. As a result, over half of NY s routing is located in the county, with the midpoint located near the city of Auburn. As NY enters Auburn, it passes by Auburn High School before heading north through densely populated blocks filled with homes. The divided highway ends abruptly at Swift Street, where NY turns west to follow the two lane undivided Swift Street west for seven blocks to NY South Street. Here, NY leaves Swift Street and joins NY on South Street. The two routes follow South Street past the William H. Seward House into downtown Auburn, where the homes are replaced with businesses at Lincoln Street. Three blocks later, South Street intersects with the East Arterial eastbound US and NY. The overlap between NY and NY ends one block later at the West Arterial westbound US and NY, where NY turns to follow the Arterial for a block to the west. Several portions of modern NY were originally part of turnpikes and plank roads during the s. On April, the New York State Legislature passed a law incorporating the Cortland and Owego Turnpike Company. The company was tasked with building a highway the Cortland and Owego Turnpike from Owego north to the then village of Cortland. It roughly followed what is now NY north from Owego to the vicinity of Harford, where it turned north to access Virgil. It continued to Cortland by way of modern NY. On April, the legislature chartered the Auburn and Port Byron Turnpike Company. The Auburn and Port Byron Turnpike began at the Auburn State Prison in Auburn and proceeded northward along the routing of NY to meet the north branch of the Seneca Turnpike in the town of Brutus now Throop. From there, the turnpike continued on NY through Port Byron to the Seneca River, where it ended at a bridge crossing the river at Mosquito Point. In, the Auburn and Moravia Plank Road Company was incorporated. They were tasked with connecting Moravia to Auburn by way of a plank road along the western side of Owasco Lake now NY. NY B. miles or. kilometres is a short spur in Broome and Tioga counties connecting NY in Newark Valley in the west to NY in Maine in the east. It was assigned in the early s. The Assembly had already done significant work on a catechism between December and January containing fifty five questions, before it decided to create two catechisms rather than one. The Larger Catechism, intended to assist ministers in teaching the Reformed faith to their congregations. The Shorter Catechism was based on the Larger Catechism but intended for use in teaching the faith to children. Parliament demanded scripture proofs for the catechisms as well. The Scots General Assembly approved both catechisms in. Covenant theology is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly developed during the seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God s dealings with men are described in terms of two covenants the covenant of works and covenant of grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works sometimes called the covenant of life, in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God s law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people. The puzzle is considered by many gamers and publications to be one of the most challenging video game puzzles of all time. Broken Sword creator and Revolution CEO Charles Cecil and Broken Sword designer Steve Ince, as well as publications which have covered it, explain that the puzzle was challenging because the player was not met with any time critical puzzle prior to this point in the game, which would mean they would not necessarily make the connection that clicking on the machinery at a key moment would make this happen. Some of the matches were changed after they were first announced, as several wrestlers left the WWF shortly before the event. Critics have praised the main event and the tag team match that was won by Savage and Perfect. Although the remaining bouts have received low ratings, critics have felt that those two matches made the event worth watching. At SummerSlam in August, The Undertaker defeated Kamala. Harvey Wippleman, Kamala s manager wanted revenge, so a rematch was scheduled for Survivor Series. The match was promoted as the WWF s first coffin match, in which the winner would place the loser in a coffin after the match. Survivor Series was attended by, fans, the same number as the previous year. It drew more fans than any of the following three Survivor Series event would draw. The pay per view buyrate was., which means that. percent of households to which the event was available purchased the pay per view. This was, to that point, the lowest buyrate in Survivor Series history and down more than one third from the previous year s. buyrate. The buyrate was higher than that of any of the following twelve Survivor Series events, however. The cast of this black and white film is unrecorded. The dialogue, captured by the film s director cum producer, was in Malay. The snakes used in the production of this film came from The Teng Chun s personal zoo. The ship mounted four calibre. inch Mk IX guns in single mounts, designated A, B, X, and Y from front to rear. For anti aircraft AA defence, Comet had a single QF inch cwt AA gun between her funnels, and two millimetre. in QF pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on the aft end of her forecastle deck. The inch mm AA gun was removed in and the pounders were relocated to between the funnels. She was fitted with two above water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for inch torpedoes. Three depth charge chutes were fitted, each with a capacity of two depth charges. After World War II began this was increased to depth charges, delivered by one or two rails and two throwers. The ship was ordered on July from Portsmouth Dockyard under the Programme. Comet was laid down on September, launched on September, as the th ship to carry the name, and completed on June. The history of artificial intelligence AI began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen as Pamela McCorduck writes, AI began with an ancient wish to forge the gods. The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain. In the s and s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain. The field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in. When access to digital computers became possible in the middle fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought. This was a new approach to creating thinking machines. There were many successful programs and new directions in the late s and s. Among the most influential were these The first generation of AI researchers made these predictions about their work, H. A. Simon and Allen Newell within ten years a digital computer will be the world s chess champion and within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem., H. A. Simon machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do., Marvin Minsky Within a generation... the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved., Marvin Minsky in Life Magazine In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being. In the s a form of AI program called expert systems was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. In those same years, the Japanese government aggressively funded AI with its fifth generation computer project. Another encouraging event in the early s was the revival of connectionism in the work of John Hopfield and David Rumelhart. Once again, AI had achieved success. Expert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful something that AI had not been able to achieve up to this point. The business community s fascination with AI rose and fell in the s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble. The collapse was in the perception of AI by government agencies and investors the field continued to make advances despite the criticism. Rodney Brooks and Hans Moravec, researchers from the related field of robotics, argued for an entirely new approach to artificial intelligence. In the late s, the Strategic Computing Initiative cut funding to AI deeply and brutally. New leadership at DARPA had decided that AI was not the next wave and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results. By, the impressive list of goals penned in for Japan s Fifth Generation Project had not been met. Indeed, some of them, like carry on a casual conversation had not been met by. As with other AI projects, expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible. On May, Deep Blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. The super computer was a specialized version of a framework produced by IBM, and was capable of processing twice as many moves per second as it had during the first match which Deep Blue had lost, reportedly, moves per second. The event was broadcast live over the internet and received over million hits. These successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm, but mostly on the tedious application of engineering skill and on the tremendous power of computers today. In fact, Deep Blue s computer was million times faster than the Ferranti Mark that Christopher Strachey taught to play chess in. This dramatic increase is measured by Moore s law, which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers doubles every two years. The fundamental problem of raw computer power was slowly being overcome. In, Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick had imagined that by the year, a machine would exist with an intelligence that matched or exceeded the capability of human beings. The character they created, HAL, was based on a belief shared by many leading AI researchers that such a machine would exist by the year. Cyclone Graham of the Australian region cyclone season was a weak tropical storm that affected Australia during late February and early March. Graham originated from an area of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over Australia on February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an area of low pressure that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on February. The storm moved slowly to the east southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported. Following the storm, the name Graham was retired from the Australian region basin. The second of two prototypes ordered on January, it was used for structural testing before being disposed of in. A third aircraft was ordered on April and it was used for research into power boosted ailerons during February. The airframe was sold to Blackburn on October.

The film completed a day run in centres on September. By then, the film had collected million US. million and stood strong. Hurricane Flossy originated from a tropical disturbance in the eastern Pacific Ocean and moved across Central America into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression on September, which became a tropical storm on September and a hurricane on September. The hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of mph km h before it struck the central Gulf coast of the United States as a Category hurricane on September, and evolved into an extratropical cyclone on September. It was the first hurricane to affect oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. The tropical cyclone led to flooding in New Orleans, and broke a drought across the eastern United States. The death toll was, and total damages reached. million USD. Total damages to Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas, and Virginia was. million USD. The battle of Bnh Gi reflected the Viet Cong s growing military strength and influence, especially in the Mekong Delta region. It was the first time the National Liberation Front launched a large scale operation, holding its ground and fighting for four days against government troops equipped with armor, artillery and helicopters, and aided by U.S. air support and military advisers. The Viet Cong demonstrated that, when well supplied with military supplies from North Vietnam, they had the ability to fight and inflict damage even on the best ARVN units. For the first time in their history, the NLF was able to control a government stronghold for several days, and inflict heavy casualties on regular units of the South Vietnamese army in a large set piece battle. Unlike their adversaries, the South Vietnamese military suffered heavily in their attempts to recapture the village of Bnh Gi and secure the surrounding areas. The South Vietnamese and their American allies lost the total of about personnel killed in action, wounded and missing. In just four days of fighting, two of South Vietnam s elite Ranger companies were destroyed and several others suffered heavy losses, while the th Marine Battalion was rendered ineffective as a fighting force. At that stage of the war, Bnh Gi was the worst defeat experienced by any South Vietnamese army. Despite the humiliating defeat inflicted on them, the South Vietnamese army stubbornly considered the battle as their victory and erected a monument at the site of the battle to acknowledge the sacrifices of the soldiers who had fallen to retake Bnh Gi. th Battalion th Company th Artillery Detachment st Airborne Battalion rd Airborne Battalion th Airborne Battalion th Marine Battalion th Ranger Battalion th Ranger Battalion rd Ranger Battalion th Ranger Battalion th Ranger Battalion Two artillery platoons and one section of M tanks in support. The response of the NDH authorities to resistance had been to burn down the villages where this had occurred, and there were mass shootings of Serbs, which escalated the level of violence even further. In late May and June, Serbs had been rounded up, tortured and killed in Nevesinje, and in early June, another Serbs had been killed at Ljubinje. In response, Serbs attacked Ustae officials and facilities, and conducted raids themselves, killing Muslim villagers. The first indication that the situation had changed significantly was on June, when a group of Ustae clashed with a group of rebels they estimated to number between and,. After an extended firefight near the village of Stepen, km. mi north of Korita, during which they suffered several casualties, the Ustae also burned down four villages. They then entered two Muslim majority villages in the area and arrested Serbs who had not been involved in the earlier fighting. The arrested Serbs were transported north to Avtovac and shot. That night, all adult Serbs above the age of in Gacko,. km. mi northwest of Avtovac, were arrested, and were immediately shot. The rest were transported km mi west to a camp in Nevesinje. Over the period June, Serbs from the village of Ravno, km mi southwest of Ljubinje, were arrested and killed at the gendarmerie post, and the remainder of the population fled to the hills. Around Gacko and Avtovac in the north, the day had been quiet. When the commander of the nd Company of the th Battalion at Gacko reported rebels gathering near the town, Prpi sent a truck mounted platoon with an ammunition resupply. The platoon was ambushed en route, with Home Guardsmen being captured. Gacko was reinforced later in the day from troops in Avtovac. On the night of June, the Nevesinje garrison was subjected to a sustained attack by the rebels, but held out. On June, Laxa became the overall commander of all NDH authorities in Hum and Dubrava counties, which included Ustae, Home Guard, civil administration, gendarmerie and police. Military courts were established to deal with those resisting the NDH authorities. Armed guards were posted at the entrance to towns and villages, and any armed civilians were to be disarmed and brought to military authorities. Laxa issued an order that gave the rebels until July to submit to the authorities. On that day, after the Prohaska group broke through to Nevesinje from Mostar, Prohaska sent a company of the th Battalion to Kifino Selo to meet the two companies of the th Battalion advancing from Pluine. Despite ZNDH air support, the company of the th Battalion was attacked by rebels near the entrance to Kifino Selo and the majority broke and ran. Prohaska had to send reserves to block the road between Nevesinje and Kifino Selo, and the companies from the th Battalion began to reconnoitre the rebel positions towards Odak. Crush s primary gameplay feature involves manipulating each game level between D and D views, allowing the player to reach platforms and locations inaccessible from within a different view. This element was noted by critics to be similar to one in Super Paper Mario, also released in, though the Zo Mode team had envisioned the concept five years prior. Crush received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising its incorporation of this dimension shifting component alongside other aspects of the game presentation. Though Crush won several gaming awards, including PSP game of the month, it failed to meet the developer s sales expectations. A port of the game for the Nintendo DS called Crush D was announced on January, and was made available on January, in Europe and on March, in North America. While Crush and its Nintendo DS port Crush D retain the same gameplay mechanics and premise, the two versions feature different plots. Note The voice actors for the story are unknown at the moment as Zo Mode never credited them In an interview, Zo Mode executive producer Paul Mottram claimed that the game concept was envisioned in, but work did not actually begin until. The initial concept was built on the crushing mechanism between D and D, and they only had to create appropriate obstacles to prevent players from simply crushing across the level. Mottram noted that during the development of Crush, the gameplay of Super Paper Mario had not yet been revealed, and thus the team was surprised to learn that it shared a similar feature. The album produced four singles. The most successful, My Happiness, reached on the ARIA Singles Chart, won the ARIA Music Award for Single of the Year, and topped Triple J s Hottest in. The album also featured These Days, which topped Triple J s Hottest in. The album was also ranked at number in Triple J s Hottest Australian Albums of All Time poll in. In a interview, Powderfinger bassist John Collins hinted that the group s next album would be similar to their previous album, Internationalist, while frontman Bernard Fanning said in September that the lyrics on the album, like those on Waiting for the Sun, were his most personal and direct yet. Fanning said his lyrics were based on the obstacles in the way of being in a relationship, especially in our work situation. Four singles were released from the album. My Kind of Scene was the first released as a promotional single in June. The track was written for the film Mission Impossible II, and appeared on its soundtrack. Collins and Middleton recalled that the song was written and produced with photos of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman on the wall of the band s studio as inspiration. They noted that the band made three songs in response to the Mission Impossible II request, and that My Kind of Scene was chosen over Up Down Back Again and Whatever Makes You Happy. The second single from the album was My Happiness, released on August in Australia. My Happiness entered the ARIA Singles Chart at, and spent weeks on the chart, making it Powderfinger s highest charting single in Australia. It peaked at on the New Zealand singles chart, and spent weeks in the top. Furthermore, My Happiness was Powderfinger s first single to chart in the USA, reaching on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Odyssey Number Five won the ARIA Awards for Album of the Year, Highest Selling Album, Best Rock Album, Best Cover Art, and Best Group. My Happiness won the award for Single of the Year, while Like a Dog was nominated for Highest Selling Single and Best Video. At the ARIA Awards, The Metre was nominated for Best Group. The album was named Album of the Year by Rolling Stone Australia readers, with My Happiness taking out Song of the Year and Powderfinger receiving Band of the Year.

Recently, an analysis of nine different methods for preparing A. muscaria for catching flies in Slovenia have shown that the release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent milk or water and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol. In the latter half of the eighteenth century, changing attitudes to such public displays prompted Sir Benjamin Hammett MP to denounce the practice in Parliament. His bill, by no means the first such attempt to end the public burning of women, led to the Treason Act, which abolished the sentence. When on June Margaret Sullivan was hanged and burned for coining, the same newspaper by then called The Times wrote The Gentleman s Magazine addressed the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger Several authors, poets and philosophers have lived on or near the Strand, including Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Virginia Woolf. The street has been commemorated in the song, Let s All Go Down the Strand, now recognised as a typical piece of Cockney music hall. Two London Underground stations were once named Strand a Piccadilly line station which was renamed Aldwych station that operated between and and a former Northern line station which today forms part of Charing Cross station. Strand Bridge was the name given to Waterloo Bridge during its construction it was renamed for its official opening on the second anniversary of the coalition victory in the Battle of Waterloo. London Bus routes, and all run along the Strand, as do numerous night bus services. In the Middle Ages, the Strand became the principal route between the separate settlements of the City of London the civil and commercial centre and the royal Palace of Westminster the national political centre. In the archaeological record, there is considerable evidence of occupation to the north of Aldwych, but much along the former foreshore has been covered by rubble from the demolition of the Tudor Somerset Place, a former royal residence, to create a large platform for the building of the first Somerset House, in the th century. The landmark Eleanor s Cross was built in the th century at the western end of the Strand at Charing Cross by Edward I commemorating his wife Eleanor of Castile. It was demolished in by the request of Parliament during the First English Civil War, but reconstructed in. President Evil is the fifth episode of the third season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars, and the forty ninth episode overall. Written by Jonathan Moskin and David Mulei and directed by Nick Marck, the episode premiered on The CW on October,. In its original broadcast, President Evil was viewed by. million viewers, ranking th of in the weekly rankings. This figure was a decrease in, viewers from the previous episode, Charlie Don t Surf. David Michael Sisler October, January, was a professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball MLB from through. Early in his career, Sisler was a starter, then later was used as a middle reliever and occasionally as a closer. He reached the majors in with the Boston Red Sox after he completed a two year obligation in the active military. After three and a half seasons with the Red Sox, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers in and served the team through the season. Before the season, he was selected by the Washington Senators in the Major League Baseball expansion draft, for whom he played the season. He was then traded to the Cincinnati Reds in, playing one season at the major league level, and one in their minor league system. His most productive years came with Boston, where he won games from to, averaging innings each season. After that, he appeared strictly as a reliever and saved a career high games for the Senators. In a seven season career, Sisler posted a record with a. ERA in appearances, including saves, complete games, one shutout and innings. Sisler retired from baseball after the season to become an investment firm executive, a career that lasted for over years, retiring as a vice chairman for A. G. Edwards. His father, Hall of Famer George Sisler and one of his brothers, Dick Sisler, also played baseball at the major league level while another brother, George Sisler, Jr., was a general manager for several minor league baseball teams, and later became president of the International League from to. Sisler died on January, of prostate cancer at the age of in St. Louis, Missouri. He was survived by his wife Janet, son and three grandchildren. In, a healthy Hamels started again at Clearwater, and after a brief stint in Reading, he was promoted to the Scranton Wilkes Barre Red Barons of the Class AAA International League. In three games at Scranton, he struck out batters while giving up only one walk and one run. His minor league statistics included a record of with a. ERA and strikeouts in games pitched. For his performance, the Phillies promoted him to the major league club. Though Hamels was the clear cut ace, Charlie Manuel penciled in Brett Myers as the Phillies opening day starter because Myers accepted his role as closer the preceding season, putting the team ahead of his personal wishes to start. Hamels was selected the Phillies starter for Game of the World Series the Phillies won, and Hamels earned his fourth win of the postseason. Hamels also started Game, which was suspended due to rain after the top of the sixth inning tied at, and receiving a no decision when game five resumed the Phillies won to clinch the World Series. Overall, Hamels made five postseason starts in, going with a. ERA. Hamels threw a total of innings during the postseason, and held opponents scoreless in of them he never allowed more than one run in any of the seven innings in which he did not hold opponents scoreless. Hamels was named the World Series MVP. The Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America presented him the Steve Carlton Most Valuable Pitcher award for the second consecutive year. Hamels started his season by signing a three year,. million contract with the Phillies. On February, the first day of spring training for pitchers and catchers, when asked who the Opening Day starter would be, manager Charlie Manuel responded, Yeah, you might as well go ahead and pencil him in. I don t think there s any sense in me playing games. Go ahead, pencil him in. Entering the season, the Phillies traded away Cliff Lee, but in doing so, acquired Roy Halladay in a mega trade. They did not re sign Myers, and Halladay was named the Phillies opening day starter. Among Hamels season highlights were a start on June against the San Diego Padres during which he threw innings of no hit baseball, winning five consecutive starts including three consecutive scoreless starts from late August to mid September, and striking out batters, tied for his second highest career total, on September against the Florida Marlins. The Phillies finished with the best record in MLB. Hamels started Game of the National League Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds and, for the first time in his postseason career, pitched a complete game shutout. The Phillies advanced to the National League Championship Series facing the San Francisco Giants, where Hamels took the loss in Game giving up three runs as the Giants Matt Cain shutout the Phillies, en route to the Phillies ultimate elimination in six games. The Phillies finished with the best record in MLB for the second year in a row. In the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Hamels started Game which resulted in a win to give the Phillies a series lead, however the Phillies would lose Games and to be eliminated. On January, Hamels and the Philadelphia Phillies agreed to a one year, million contract to avoid arbitration. This was the highest salary ever paid to a pitcher eligible for arbitration before free agency. Hamels finished the season with career highs in wins and strikeouts, and finished eighth in the NL Cy Young Award voting. His. ERA ranked second best in his career behind only his. ERA in. The Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America presented him the Steve Carlton Most Valuable Pitcher award. Despite Hamels poor record and ERA, of his starts were quality starts, and thus he gave his team a chance to win times, yet only got eight wins. Despite lack of run support contributing to a poor win loss record, Hamels was among the best pitchers in the National League, and was even mentioned as a Cy Young candidate. On September, Hamels pitched six innings of a Phillies combined no hitter against the Atlanta Braves. Hamels was pulled for a pinch hitter in the top of the seventh due to having five walks, a hit batter, and pitches through six innings. Overall, Hamels was the only consistent star on the Phillies, finished sixth in Cy Young voting, and was frequently mentioned as a candidate to be traded in the offseason to bolster the Phillies lackluster farm system, after he avoided being dealt at the July trading deadline. At the start of the season, there was much focus and speculation regarding trade possibilities surrounding Hamels. The Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, and San Francisco Giants expressed interest in trading for him during the season. The Rangers lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in five games in the Division Series after squandering a series lead. Hamels received a no decision in Game as he left the game tied, but the Rangers won in innings. Hamels started Game, and was pulled in the bottom of the th inning while the Rangers were leading the Jays subsequently scored runs to win, and Hamels was charged with the loss as he was responsible for the runners on base. Kyra, also known by her title the Seer, is a fictional character from the American television supernatural drama Charmed, which aired on the WB Television Network the WB from to. Charmed follows the supernatural adventures of the Charmed Ones, a trio of sisters known as the most powerful witches of all time. The character was created by executive producer Brad Kern and was portrayed by actress Charisma Carpenter. Carpenter was invited on the show after acting with Charmed cast member Holly Marie Combs on the ABC Family television film See Jane Date. The actress original contract was a guest star role that included three episodes in season seven, with media outlets reporting the possibility of Carpenter becoming a series regular. No fossil remains of dodo like birds have ever been found on Runion. A few later sources take issue with the proposed ibis identity of the solitaire, and have even regarded the white dodo as a valid species. British writer Errol Fuller agrees that the th century paintings do not depict Runion birds, but has questioned whether the ibis subfossils are necessarily connected to the solitaire accounts. He notes that no evidence indicates the extinct ibis survived until the time Europeans reached Runion. Cheke and Hume have dismissed such sentiments as being mere belief and hope in the existence of a dodo on the island. Contemporary accounts described the species as having white and grey plumage merging into yellow, black wing tips and tail feathers, a long neck and legs, and limited flight capabilities. Sieur Dubois account is the most detailed contemporary description of the bird, here as translated by Hugh Strickland in Over the next few days, Khnh embarked on a media offensive, repeatedly criticizing U.S. policy and decrying what he saw as an undue influence and infringement on Vietnamese sovereignty, explicitly condemning Taylor and declaring the nation s independence from foreign manipulation. Khnh and the Young Turks began preparations to expel Taylor before changing their minds however, Khnh s misleading tactics had rallied the Young Turks around his fragile leadership for at least the short term future. The Americans were forced to back down on their insistence that the HNC be restored and did not carry through on Taylor s threats to cut off aid, despite Saigon s defiance. At this point, Khnh had not spoken up and allowed the impression that the moves had been made without his consultation or against his will, and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves. Hng had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over Khnh. On the morning of December, as part of his Order of the Day, a regular message to the armed forces over Radio Vietnam, Khnh went back on his promise to leave the country and announced, We make sacrifices for the country s independence and the Vietnamese people s liberty, but not to carry out the policy of any foreign country. He said it was better to live poor but proud as free citizens of an independent country rather than in ease and shame as slaves of the foreigners and Communists. Khnh pledged support for both Hng and Suu s civilian rule, and condemned colonialism in a thinly veiled reference to the US. The National League wild card tie breaker game was a one game extension to Major League Baseball s MLB regular season, played between the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants to determine the winner of the National League NL wild card. The game took place at Wrigley Field in Chicago, on September,. The Cubs won the game, holding the Giants scoreless for the majority of the game until the Giants threatened heavily in the ninth inning and scored all three of their runs. As a result of the game, the Cubs qualified for the postseason and the Giants did not. The Mets were tied with the Cubs and Giants in the wild card race as late in the season as September at. However, the Mets lost their remaining two games and finished their season one game back of the Cubs and Giants who ended tied at. This record was also the best non division winning record and as such a tie breaker was necessary to determine the wild card winner. A coin flip on September gave the Cubs home field advantage, setting Wrigley Field as the location for the game. In the event of a three way tie the Cubs were presented with the choice to either host two home games or receive a bye and play the winner of a Mets Giants game on the road because they had the best combined record against the Mets and Giants. Cubs general manager Ed Lynch decided on the second option, though the choice was moot as the Mets fell out of the race. The Cubs Steve Trachsel and Mark Gardner of the Giants were slated to start the tie breaker on the September.

It is an important natural estuary that supports a diverse collection of wildlife, and attracts many tourists. The bay s abundance of petroleum and natural gas has attracted industry, and its strategic location on the Texas coast is ideal for military establishment. Tropical Depression One E moved slowly to the northwest while strengthening slowly due to easterly vertical wind shear. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alma on May. The storm quickly strengthened once the vertical wind shear relaxed and was near hurricane force by the morning of May. Hurricane Alma reached its peak intensity early on May with maximum sustained winds of mph km h. The hurricane entered an area of southwesterly wind shear caused by an upper level ridge of high pressure. The increasing vertical wind shear and cooler water caused Alma to weaken to a tropical storm. On May, the storm continued to weaken and became a depression. The next day, the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone well west of mainland Mexico. Alma became the earliest named storm and hurricane in the satellite era in the east Pacific proper. A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa on May. The wave moved across Central America into the northeastern Pacific Ocean, where convection organized with the system on June. The system became well enough organized to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Three E on June, while mi, km south of the southern tip of Baja California. The depression continued to strengthen, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Cristina on June. Cristina initially had well established upper level outflow. It failed to reach hurricane status, peaking with maximum sustained winds of mph km h due to movement of its associated upper level anticyclone to the north over Mexico which caused Cristina to be exposed to easterly vertical wind shear. Cristina moved generally northwestward, which eventually placed the storm in cooler waters, and caused the deep convection of the system to dissipate. On June, Cristina diminished to a tropical depression. Cristina moved west northwestward with the low level flow. The depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on June, after a lack of deep convection for hours. A tropical wave came off the coast of Africa into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on June and. The system moved across the Atlantic and entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The wave became a significant tropical system, with cyclonic turning in the lower and middle layers of the system s cloudiness on June. The center of circulation was located mi km south of Acapulco, Mexico. The system exhibited sufficient organization to be considered Tropical Depression Five E on June. The depression quickly strengthened and became Tropical Storm Elida later that day. The track of Elida was west northwestward to northwestward from June through June. Some rainbands moved over the mountainous region of southwestern Mexico, but no flooding, damage, or casualties were reported as a result. Elida continued strengthening and it was upgraded to a hurricane early on June passing directly over Socorro Island later in the day, right as Elida reached peak strength of mph km h, dropping. in mm of rain on the island. Some windows broke also as a result, and minor structural damage was reported as a result on the island. An area of disturbed weather south of Acapulco organized into Tropical Depression Six E on June and the system began to move northwest. Originally the system was expected to reach tropical storm strength and near hurricane intensity by late on July or early on July, however persistent vertical wind shear over the system impeded its development. After convection began to merge into the Intertropical Convergence Zone ITCZ, the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Tropical Depression Six E, stating that the depression dissipated, and regeneration seemed unlikely. A tropical wave came off the northwest coast of Africa on June. The wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, into the warm waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean, on July. An area of disturbed weather moved northwards towards the Gulf of Tehuantepec and became Tropical Depression Seven E early on July. The depression moved northwest, and because of increased organization of deep convection, was designated Tropical Storm Fausto on July, mi km south of Manzanillo, Mexico. A weakly defined eye formed on July, and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Fausto, mi km south of Cabo San Lucas. Fausto peaked in strength with winds of mph km h and a central pressure of mb. inHg on July. Fausto passed mi km north of Socorro Island causing a northwest wind of mph km h, and. in mm of rain at that location. The hurricane fluctuated in intensity on July, before weakening into a tropical storm later that day, mi km west of Cabo San Lucas. The weakening Fausto moved over continuing cooler waters, and was downgraded to a tropical depression on June, mi, km west of Cabo San Lucas. The depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on June, and its low level circulation of clouds persisted for a few days. A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on June and moved across the Atlantic Ocean and central Caribbean Sea with little development. Within the western Caribbean Sea, convection developed with the wave on July. The system became better organized as it moved into the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Eight E on July. The depression moved west northwest, with a good outflow to the north, and gradually strengthened into Tropical Storm Genevieve later that day. Genevieve continued to strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on July. The storm approached within mi km of Socorro Island where a sustained wind of mph km h and gust of mph km h were reported, before the weather equipment on the island failed. Hernan kept Category hurricane intensity a few more days and hurricane strength for six days overall. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm on July as it moved over cooler waters. Hernan turned more to the west as its low level center became separated from its thunderstorm activity and was steering by a surface high pressure system to its north. Hernan moved over cooler waters, dissipating as a tropical cyclone early on July. On July a tropical disturbance behind Hurricane Hernan strengthened into a tropical depression. Due to the close proximity of Hernan to its west, the development of the depression was hindered due to vertical wind shear from the outflow of Hernan. This wind shear dissipated the depression on July, and its remnants were absorbed by the nearby cyclone. No damages or casualties were caused by the depression as it was well out to sea. Tropical Storm Aka was the only tropical storm to form in the Central North Pacific during. An area of disturbed weather began to organize on August. By August, the system became well enough organized to become designated Tropical depression One C. The depression intensified into a tropical storm while moving west, to the south of the Hawaiian Islands. On August, Tropical Storm Aka peaked with maximum sustained winds of mph km h. The storm continued to move west and approached Johnston Island, though the island s weather did not deteriorate. The tropical storm crossed the International Date Line on August. Aka weakened back into a depression and dissipated two days later on August. Hurricane Diana struck eastern Mexico and managed to hold together, remaining a tropical depression as it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean late on August. Although Tropical Depression Diana entered the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center did not re classify the system. No re intensification occurred after the system entered the eastern Pacific, and it had dissipated as a tropical cyclone by the following day. The remnant tropical disturbance recurved through the Gulf of California while developing significant convection before it moved into northwest Mexico, which brought rainfall amounts of over in mm to local areas within the state of Sonora. The remnant disturbance moved into the American Southwest on August. Tropical Depression Two C was the second and last tropical cyclone to develop within the north central Pacific Ocean in. The depression developed from a tropical disturbance well southeast of Hawaii, which became much better organized on the night of August. The tropical depression moved in a west northwest direction for the next hours and then changed to a west southwest track on August. As it turned more to the southwest, the depression weakened until it dissipated on August about mi km south southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. A tropical wave moved off the northwestern coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on August. After moving across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea without development, the system moved through the Intertropical Convergence Zone of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The cloudiness moved northward toward the Gulf of Tehuantepec on August. The thunderstorm activity organized sufficiently for the system to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Fifteen E on August while mi km southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The depression moved west northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm mi km south southwest of Puerto Vallarta on August. The storm began to turn more westward due to a strengthening high pressure system to its north and was upgraded to a hurricane on August while mi km southwest of Cabo San Lucas. As the high to the north continued to strengthen, the hurricane turned west southwest. A weaker than normal high pressure system controlled the movement of the depression, and the system moved slowly to the west through its duration. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Marie on September, and into a hurricane on September, while mi km south southwest of Clarion Island. Marie reached its peak intensity of mph km h on September. The hurricane crossed into the central North Pacific on September as a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of mph km h. The hurricane weakened thereafter and on September Marie regained tropical storm status. The system weakened into a tropical depression on September and dissipated as a tropical cyclone on September near the Hawaiian coast. No casualties or damages were caused by Marie. On September, Norbert absorbed Tropical Depression Eighteen E which was in close proximity. Norbert strengthened as it moved north northwestward. The tropical storm was upgraded to a hurricane on September, and formed an eye on September. The storm reached its peak strength of mph km h sustained winds that day. Turning north of due west, Norbert then weakened as it moved over cooler waters. It was downgraded to a tropical storm later on September, and then to a tropical depression on September. Norbert dissipated as a tropical cyclone on September after losing all its deep convection. On September, satellite images indicated that the eighteenth tropical depression of the season formed southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Located in close proximity to Tropical Storm Norbert, the depression would soon enter a region of colder sea surface temperatures, and the National Hurricane Center noted that only very little intensification was possible. As predicted, Norbert hindered further intensification of Tropical Depression Eighteen E. The National Hurricane Center noted six hours later that the depression would likely be absorbed into Norbert. The National Hurricane Center later believed that Tropical Depression Eighteen E was dominating the interaction between the two systems, and was forecast to absorb Norbert. Unlike the latter prediction, Norbert absorbed Tropical Depression Eighteen E later that day. A tropical wave move off the coast of Africa on September, and crossed the Atlantic waters, the Caribbean Sea and eventually into the Pacific Ocean as a weak system. An area of convection entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean a few hundred miles south of Acapulco, Mexico. On September, Tropical Depression Nineteen E formed from this convection, while mi, km south southeast from the southern tip of Baja California. The depression moved on a west northwestward track, rounding the southwest side of a strong high pressure system. The depression continued to strengthen and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Odile on September and into a hurricane on September. Its intensity peaked with maximum sustained winds of mph km h on September. The hurricane began to turn more northwestward in response to a high pressure system weakening to its north. Odile began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters on September. The cyclone regained tropical storm status on September while it slowly progressed northward. The system weakened into a tropical depression status on September. Once it lost its deep convection, Odile was steered southwestward by the low level flow, before it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on October. Its remaining low level circulation of clouds continued on a southwestward course thereafter. The highest rainfall total from the system in Mexico totaled. in mm at Santa Anita near the tip of Baja California. Across northern Mexico, thousands were homeless, and people died. In Texas, Rachel s remnants caused heavy rain. Flooding occurred in the Big Bend area. Polo originated from a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on September which spawned Hurricane Isidore in the Atlantic basin. On September, the system increased in convection as it was moving to the west and approaching Central America. The southern extent of the wave crossed into the Pacific Ocean on September. The wave continued westward and related thunderstorm activity increased during the following week. The convective system organized into Tropical Depression Twenty E on September nearly midway between Mexico and Hawaii. Initially, the depression drifted toward the northwest due to a large upper level trough located to its west. Polo strengthened rapidly into a hurricane early on September, with its winds peaking at mph km h. Since the storm was very small, vertical wind shear caused significant weakening thereafter. On October, Polo regained tropical storm strength as it was crossing into the north Central Pacific basin. It dissipated as a tropical cyclone later that day. There were no casualties or damages caused by Polo. Except for Socorro Island, Trudy had no impact on land. The island reported hurricane force winds for seven hours. Trudy also had an unusually large eye, which was as large as mi km wide. Trudy is the fourth strongest Pacific hurricane in October, behind Kenna of the season, Rick of the season, and Patricia of the season. Trudy also spent hours of its life as a Category hurricane, longer than any other hurricane in the Eastern Pacific basin. The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in. No names were retired, so it was used again in the season. This is the same list used for the season. Storms were named Trudy and Vance for the first time in. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. One name from the Central Pacific list was used Aka. It was the first usage for that name. Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running, jumping, and throwing. The name is derived from the sport s typical venue a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking. It is one of the oldest sports. In ancient times, it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the Ancient Olympic Games in Greece. In modern times, the two most prestigious international track and field competitions are athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The International Association of Athletics Federations is the international governing body. Records are kept of the best performances in specific events, at world and national levels, right down to a personal level. However, if athletes are deemed to have violated the event s rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased. In North America, the term track and field may be used to refer to other athletics events, such as the marathon, rather than strictly track based events. That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation IAAF was established, becoming the international governing body for track and field, and it enshrined amateurism as one of its founding principles for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men s Outdoor Track and Field Championship in, making it one of the most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed by the introduction of track and field at the inaugural World Student Games in. The first continental track and field competition was the South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in. Note Events in italics are competed at indoor world championships only Beyond the short distances of sprinting events, factors such as an athlete s reactions and top speed becomes less important, while qualities such as pace, race tactics and endurance become more so. There are three common long distance running events in track and field competitions metres, metres and, metres. The latter two races are both Olympic and World Championship events outdoors, while the m is held at the IAAF World Indoor Championships. The m and, m events have their historical roots in the mile and mile races. The m was historically used as a women s long distance event, entering the World Championship programme in and Olympic programme in, but this was abandoned in favour of a women s m event in. The IAAF keeps world records for five different types of track relays. As with m and m events, all races comprise teams of four athletes running the same distances, with the less commonly contested distances being the m, m and m relays. Other events include the distance medley relay comprising legs of m, m, m, and m, which is frequently held in the United States, and a sprint relay, known as the Swedish medley relay, which is popular in Scandinavia and held at the World Youth Championships in Athletics programme. Relay events have significant participation in the United States, where a number of large meetings or relay carnivals are focused almost exclusively on relay events. By far the most common events are the metres hurdles for women, m hurdles for men and m hurdles for both sexes. The men s m has been featured at every modern Summer Olympics while the men s m was introduced in the second edition of the Games. Women s initially competed in the metres hurdles event, which entered the Olympic programme in. This was extended to the m hurdles at the Olympics, but it was not until that a women s m hurdles event took place at the Olympics having been introduced at the World Championships in Athletics the previous year. Outside of the hurdles events, the steeplechase race is the other track and field event with obstacles. Just as the hurdling events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the English championships and the Summer Olympics featured men s m and m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the Summer Olympics marked the rise of the metres steeplechase as the standard event. The IAAF set the standards of the event in, and the event is held on a m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap. Despite the long history of men s steeplechase in track and field, the women s steeplechase only gained World Championship status in, with its first Olympic appearance coming in. The men s triple jump competition has been ever present at the modern Olympics, but it was not until that a women s version gained World Championship status and went on to have its first Olympic appearance three years later. The men s standing triple jump event featured at the Olympics in and, but such competitions have since become very uncommon, although it is still used as a non competitive exercise drill. Track and field contains some of the foremost kinds of throwing sports, and the four major disciplines are the only pure throwing events to feature at the Olympic Games. All four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run alongside the central m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put or weight throw is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area is similar to the outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier. In addition to hosting the World Indoor Championships, the IAAF has hosted the IAAF World Indoor Tour since. The rules of track athletics or of track events in athletics as observed in most international athletics competitions are set by the Competition Rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations IAAF. The most recent complete set of rules is the rules that relate only to competitions in. Key rules of track events are those regarding starting, running and finishing. The start of a race is marked by a white line cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish. Starting blocks may be used for all races up to and including m including the first leg of the m and m and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane. For sprint races up to m, the starter gives two commands on your marks to instruct athletes to approach the start line, followed by set to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent. The commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions, or in English or French in international competitions. Once all athletes are set in their starting position, the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated. If the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed, the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over. In general, most field events allow a competitor to take their attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the longest distance. Men and women have different weights for their throwing implements men s javelin is grams compared to for women, men s weight throw is pounds compared to for women, men s discus is kilograms to women s, men s shot put is pounds compared to pounds for women, and men s hammer throw is also pounds to the women s. Additionally, men s high hurdles are at height of inches compared to women s hurdles which are inches. For the intermediate hurdles meter hurdles, the men s hurdle height is inches compared to inches for women. The international governance of track and field falls under the jurisdiction of athletics organisations. The International Association of Athletics Federations is the global governing body for track and field, and athletics as a whole. The governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA Track Field and the Philippine Amateur Track Field Association, but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies. These national federations regulate sub national and local track and field clubs, as well as other types of running clubs. The major global track and field competitions are both held under the scope of athletics. Track and field contests make up the majority of events on the Olympic and Paralympic athletics programmes, which occur every four years. Track and field events have held a prominent position at the Summer Olympics since its inception in, and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Events such as the metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event. Similar to the event programmes at the Olympics, Paralympics and World Championships, track and field forms a significant part of continental championships. The South American Championships in Athletics, created in, was the first continental championships and the European Athletics Championships became the second championships of this type in. The Asian Athletics Championships and African Championships in Athletics were created in the s and Oceania started its championships in. There are also indoor continental competitions in Europe European Athletics Indoor Championships and Asia Asian Indoor Athletics Championships. There has not been a consistent championships for all of North America, which may be in part due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships. However, the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country. One day track and field meetings form the most common and seasonal aspect of the sport they are the most basic level of track and field competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation only basis. The next most important record type are those achieved at a specific competition. For example, the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions. Isabella Mary Beeton ne Mayson March February, also known as Mrs Beeton, was an English journalist, editor and writer. Her name is particularly associated with her first book, the work Mrs Beeton s Book of Household Management. She was born in London and, after schooling in Islington, north London, and Heidelberg, Germany, she married Samuel Orchart Beeton, an ambitious publisher and magazine editor. In September the Beetons released a new, weekly publication called The Queen, the Ladies Newspaper. With the Beetons busy running their other titles, they employed Frederick Greenwood as the editor. Isabella was buried at West Norwood Cemetery on February. When The Dictionary of Every Day Cookery was published in the same year, Samuel added a tribute to his wife at the end Her works speak for themselves and, although taken from this world in the very height and strength, and in the early days of womanhood, she felt satisfaction so great to all who strive with good intent and warm will of knowing herself regarded with respect and gratitude. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by. million household viewers, an improvement over the previous week. Kaboom received generally positive reviews, with several commentators praising the series for resolving the long standing pit subplot. The Middle Colonies comprised the middle region of the Thirteen Colonies of the British Empire in North America. Much of the area was part of the New Netherland until the British exerted their control over the region. The English captured much of the area in its war with the Dutch around, and the majority of the conquered land became the Province of New York. The Duke of York and the King of England would later grant others ownership of the land which would become the Province of New Jersey and the Province of Pennsylvania. The Delaware Colony later separated from Pennsylvania, which was founded by William Penn. The Provincial Congress of New Jersey, made up of elected delegates, formed in January to govern the colony. The Congress had Royal Governor William Franklin arrested on June, declaring him an enemy to the liberties of this country. On July, New Jersey enacted the New Jersey State Constitution, soon after having empowered delegates to the Continental Congress, on June, to join in a declaration of independence. The United States Declaration of Independence ended their colonial status. In, the Province of New Jersey split from New York however, the New York New Jersey Line War continued until the final borders were decided in, and approved by the legislatures and the King in and respectively. A Colonial Assembly convened in October, making New York the last colony to have an assembly. A constitution was drafted and passed on October, giving the colonists many rights, including the rights to taxation without representation. However, upon learning of the constitution, James II declared it void. The Middle Colonies political groups began as small groups with narrowly focused goals. These coalitions eventually grew into diverse and large political organizations, evolving especially during the French and Indian War. Both William Penn and the Lords Baltimore encouraged Irish Protestant immigration, hoping they could obtain indentured servants to work on their estates and on colonial developments. Often areas of the Middle Colonies displayed prevalent Irish cultural influence. The Bath Assembly Rooms, designed by John Wood, the Younger in, are a set of elegant assembly rooms located in the heart of the World Heritage City of Bath in England which are now open to the public as a visitor attraction. They are designated as a Grade I listed building. The Assembly Rooms formed the hub of fashionable Georgian society in the city, the venue being described as the most noble and elegant of any in the kingdom. They were originally known as the Upper Rooms as there was also a lower assembly room in the city, which closed soon after the Upper Rooms opened. They served the newly built fashionable area which included The Circus, Queen Square and the Royal Crescent. Mrs Allen was so long in dressing, that they did not enter the ball room till late. The season was full, the room crowded, and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could. As for Mr Allen, he repaired directly to the card room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves. Today the rooms are owned by the National Trust and operated by Bath and North East Somerset Council. The main rooms are still available for hire for private functions. They are also used for concerts, including ones that are part of the Bath International Music Festival. The basement of the building provides a home to the Fashion Museum, which was known before as the Museum of Costume. The collection was started by Doris Langley Moore, who gave her collection to the city of Bath in. It focuses on fashionable dress for men, women and children from the late th century to the present day and has more than, objects. The earliest pieces are embroidered shirts and gloves from about. Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine was a pulp magazine which was launched in December. It was published by Harold Hersey, and was an attempt to cash in on the growing comics boom, and the popularity of the Flash Gordon comic strip in particular. The magazine contained a novel about Flash Gordon and three unrelated stories there were also eight full page color illustrations. The quality of both the artwork and the fiction was low, and the magazine only saw a single issue. It is now extremely rare. The attempt to market pulp fiction to comics fans turned out to be the wrong approach the comics field was on the verge of dramatic successes, but the crossover appeal for pulp magazines was not there. The magazine was not widely known at the time it was issued, and has since become extremely rare. Tropical Storm Olaf was an erratic and long lived tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to regions of Mexico, which would be devastated by Hurricane Pauline a week later. The sixteenth named storm of the season, Olaf formed on September off the southern coast of Mexico. It moved northward and quickly intensified, reaching peak winds of mph km h before weakening and hitting Oaxaca as a tropical depression. In Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala, the system brought heavy rainfall, which killed people and caused flooding and damage. It was originally thought that Olaf dissipated over Mexico, although its remnants continued westward for a week. It interacted with Hurricane Pauline, which caused Olaf to turn to the southeast and later to the north to strike Mexico again, finally dissipating on October. Following the storm, the Mexican government sent food, water, and housing supplies to affected families in Oaxaca. Less than a week after Olaf moved through southern Mexico, Hurricane Pauline struck the same region with much stronger winds. Pauline caused heavier rainfall and more damage, killing at least people. Some regions received days of heavy rainfall. Two of the musical numbers, All I Really Want for Christmas and Christmastime is Killing Us were released as digital downloads on iTunes. Christmastime is Killing Us was available on December, while All I Really Want for Christmas was made available on December,. Road to the North Pole was broadcast on December, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by The Simpsons, and followed by Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane s second show, American Dad,. It was watched by. million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with the Desperate Housewives on ABC, The Amazing Race and Undercover Boss on CBS and Sunday Night Football on NBC. The episode also acquired a. rating in the demographic, beating American Dad, and The Simpsons in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership. The episode s ratings increased significantly from the previous week s episode. The episode was also nominated for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for song Christmastime Is Killing Us, written by Ron Jones, Seth MacFarlane, and Danny Smith and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series Half Hour and Animation. It won for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series Half Hour and Animation. Christmastime Is Killing Us was nominated for Best Song Written for a Visual Media at the th Grammy Awards. Edward Grant Barrow May, December, was an American manager and front office executive in Major League Baseball. He served as the field manager of the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox. He served as business manager de facto general manager of the New York Yankees from to and as team president from to, and is credited with building the Yankee dynasty. Barrow was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in. Born in a covered wagon in Springfield, Illinois, Barrow worked as a journalist and soap salesman before entering the business of baseball by selling concessions at games. From there, Barrow purchased minor league baseball teams, also serving as team manager, and served as president of the Atlantic League. After managing the Tigers in and and returning to the minor leagues, Barrow became disenchanted with baseball, and left the game to operate a hotel. Barrow moved to Pittsburgh in, where he worked as a soap salesman, believing there was money in this business. However, Barrow lost all of money in this business, and went to work as a desk clerk in a Pittsburgh hotel. From through, Barrow served as president of the Atlantic League. During this time, in the winter of, Barrow and Jake Wells established a movie theater in Richmond, Virginia. Barrow managed Paterson again in, but the league folded after the season. Barrow returned to baseball in, managing Montreal. The Eastern League hired Barrow as its president the next year, giving him an annual salary of, in current dollar terms. He served in this role from through, and engineered the name change to International League before the season. As league president, he contended with the creation of the Federal League in, which competed as a major league, and established franchises in International League cities, including Newark, New Jersey, Buffalo, New York, and Baltimore, Maryland. He attempted to gain major league status for the league in, but was unsuccessful. When the Federal League collapsed, Barrow was the only league president to forbid the outlaw players from playing in his league. After the season, Barrow attempted to organize the Union League, to compete against the AL and NL as a third major league, by merging four International League clubs with four teams from the American Association. Several International League owners opposed Barrow s policies, including his attempt to form the Union League, and felt he was too close personally to Ban Johnson. When the league s owners voted to cut his pay to, after the season, in current dollar terms, Barrow resigned. Barrow was an able boxer. He once fought John L. Sullivan in an exhibition for four rounds. In May, an exhibition game was played in honor of Barrow, with Barrow managing a team of retired stars. Barrow was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in. On April, the Yankees dedicated a plaque to Barrow, which first hung on the center field wall at Yankee Stadium, near the flagpole and the monuments to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Miller Huggins. The plaques later moved to the stadium s Monument Park. Before the writing of S.R., the writers for The X Files felt that the character of Walter Skinner was becoming too expendable. John Shiban, the writer of the episode, decided to re work Skinner back into the series mythology by crafting the episode around him. Mitch Pileggi had to endure long bouts of make up application, a process that he admitted he hated. The nanobots in the blood sample were designed on a computer and then rendered for the final footage. Bradford City Association Football Club also known informally as Bradford City are an English football club founded in Bradford in to introduce the sport to the West Riding of Yorkshire, which until then had been almost entirely inclined towards rugby league. Before they had even played their first game, City were elected to the Football League to replace Doncaster Rovers in Division Two, and took over the Valley Parade stadium, which has been their permanent home ground ever since. The club won the Division Two title in and the FA Cup in, both under the management of Peter O Rourke, before they were relegated from Division One in. In, the club came close to returning to the top division when they missed out on promotion on the final day of the season. Following relegation back to Division Three, after Geoffrey Richmond became chairman in January the club s fortunes were lifted. He helped to take them to their first appearance at Wembley and subsequently into the Premier League, where they played for two seasons. Following Richmond s self proclaimed six weeks of madness and the collapse of television channel ITV Digital, the club suffered its first spell in administration. Another period under administration followed, and City dropped through the leagues of professional English football back to the bottom tier of The Football League, until promotion in brought them back up a division. In January, City became the first club from the fourth tier of English football since to reach the Football League Cup final, and the first fourth tier club ever to reach a major Wembley Cup Final. The good form continued the following season, and from October to mid December, City embarked on a match unbeaten run, during which time Campbell became the club s all time leading goalscorer, beating Frank O Rourke s year old record. City went top of the division and held onto their lead, opening an point cushion by February. Promotion was secured in April and the club s first championship title since after a win over Bolton Wanderers. The success was overshadowed when fire ripped through Valley Parade s main stand minutes into the final game of the season on May against Lincoln City. A total of people died and the club did not play another game at Valley Parade for nearly months. Former England captain Bryan Robson took over as new manager during the following season, but, under his management, City won only seven games from and were relegated in rd place. Robson left and was replaced by his assistant Colin Todd. The club went into administration for a second time, but Todd led them to th in each of the following two seasons. Following fan pressure and a poor run of results, Rhodes sacked Todd on February, with City just three points above the relegation zone. Wetherall was appointed player manager on a temporary basis and then for the rest of the season, but City were relegated following a defeat to Chesterfield. During the summer of, former midfielder Stuart McCall returned as manager with City in the bottom tier for the first time in years. He set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season, but twice missed out on promotion before he left the club in February with City lying th in League Two.

The Black section deals with Sephiroth, the White section with Aerith. Forbidden Fruit is a song by American hip hop recording artist J. Cole. The song was sent to radio stations in August, as the third official single from Cole s second studio album, Born Sinner. Forbidden Fruit was produced by Cole himself and features a guest appearance from frequent collaborator and fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar, who contributes vocals to the song s hook. The song features a sample of American jazz musician Ronnie Foster s Mystic Brew, most recognized from its use on hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest s Electric Relaxation. The song was met with mixed reviews from music critics. Forbidden Fruit would peak at number on the Billboard Hot R B Hip Hop Songs chart. Forbidden Fruit was the last song recorded and produced by J. Cole for his second album, Born Sinner. It was recorded as a replacement for another song which Cole was forced to remove from the album s track listing after failing to obtain sample clearance from the estate of Jimi Hendrix. The song s production is based around a looped sample of American jazz musician Ronnie Foster s Mystic Brew, which was also famously sampled by hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest on their song Electric Relaxation. Cole was inspired to incorporate the Foster sample into Forbidden Fruit after hearing Electric Relaxation, saying I was like, Oh, man. What if, You know what I mean, Like, What if I could just do it my way, You know what I mean, It s such a classic and people are so afraid to touch classics. And I was just like, What if I could flip it, So I just went and found the original sample. Credits adapted from the liner notes of Born Sinner. J.

It is among the earliest extant log churches in Hampshire County, along with Capon Chapel and Mount Bethel Church. Old Pine Church reportedly housed a school in the early th century while still serving as a center for worship. In, residents of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to perform a restoration of the church. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December, due to its significant settlement era rural religious architecture in the Potomac Highlands. Old Pine Church and its cemetery are located along the steeply sloped Old Pine Church Road West Virginia Secondary Route, approximately. miles. kilometres south of the unincorporated community of Purgitsville. The church and cemetery are situated on. acres. hectares atop a bluff to the west of United States Route, at an elevation of, feet metres. The property is surrounded by old growth forests. The dates of the earliest church cannot be verified, but a church building may have been constructed at the site of Old Pine Church as early as around, and possibly as early as. As of, Old Pine Church is still used for community gatherings, funeral services, revival meetings, and an annual church service. Regular church services have not taken place in the church since the middle of the th century. The church s adjacent cemetery also continues to be used for burials. Throughout its existence, Old Pine Church has been known by various names, including Mill Church, Nicholas Church, and simply Pine Church. Architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi states that the simple form and construction of Old Pine Church are indicative of the early settlers access to materials and are an example of the log construction techniques used in the religious architecture of Hampshire County s earliest settlers. She adds that Old Pine Church is representative of a simple design and form common to the early ecclesiastical buildings and an excellent example of one of the area s early rural church complexes. The church s interior exhibits an open architectural plan. A plain wooden frame pulpit stands against the rear wall, underneath the middle window. The church s floor consists of pine boards installed during the church s restoration. The church s small wood burning stove originally occupied the center of the sanctuary but was moved to the church s north wall in later years. It continues to serve as the church s sole source of heat.

It received a score of. based on reviews on GameRankings and based on reviews on Metacritic. Ryan Fleming of Digital Trends wrote that the collection is perhaps the best value buy for any console available, and that for fans of the series, this collection is not for you as all games with the exception of God of War III are available for download, and it will likely be redundant. However, new or inexperienced players should buy it. Fleming added that it was odd that the PSP games were included as downloads, and would like to have seen content migrate over to the PlayStation Vita. Jeffrey L. Wilson of PC Magazine gave the collection a out of and called it an excellent purchase for anyone looking for cinematic, blood drenched action especially newcomers who get five titles for the price of one, but added that long time fans may not find much value in the collection. The territorial era of Minnesota covers the history of the land that is now the modern US state of Minnesota from the Louisiana Purchase in, to its achieving statehood in. The Minnesota Territory itself was formed only in but the area had a rich history well before this. Though there was a long history of European presence in the area before th century, it was during the th century that the United States began to establish a firm presence in what would become Minnesota. This era was a period of economic transition. The dominant enterprise in the area since the th century had been the fur trade. The Dakota Sioux, and later the Ojibwe, tribes hunted and gathered pelts trading with French, British, and later American traders at Grand Portage, Mendota, and other sites. This trade gradually declined during the early th century as demand for furs in Europe diminished. The lumber industry grew rapidly, replacing furs as the key economic resource. Grain production began to develop late during this time as an emerging economic basis as well. Saw mills, and later grain mills, around Fort Snelling and Saint Anthony Falls in east central Minnesota became magnets for development. By the end of the era east central Minnesota had replaced northern Minnesota as the economic center of the area. This era was also as a period of cultural transition. At the time the U.S. took possession of the region, Native Americans were by far the largest ethnic groups. Their role in the fur trade gave them a steady stream of income and significant political influence even as the French, British, and Americans asserted territorial claims on the area. French and British traders had mixed with native society in the area for many decades peacefully contributing to the society and creating new ethnic groups consisting of mixed race peoples. As the Americans established outposts in the area and the fur trade declined, the dynamics changed dramatically. The economic influence of the Native Americans diminished and American territorial ideology increasingly sought to limit their influence. Large waves of immigration in the s very suddenly changed the demographics so that within a few years the population shifted from predominantly native to predominantly people of European descent. The native and mixed race populations continued to influence the territory s culture and politics, even at the end of the territorial era, though by the time statehood was achieved that influence was in steep decline. Heavy immigration from New England and New York led to Minnesota s being labeled the New England of the West. Though the various parts of what is now Minnesota were claimed at different times by Spain, France, and Britain, none of these nations made significant efforts to establish major settlements in the area. Instead the French and the British established mostly trading posts and utilized the natives in the area as suppliers. Most of the remaining areas of what is now the state were purchased in from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase the area west of the Mississippi having been recently acquired by France from Spain. Parts of northern Minnesota were considered to be in Rupert s Land, a large territory owned by Hudson s Bay Company. The exact definition of the boundary between Minnesota and British North America was not addressed until the Anglo American Convention of. At the beginning of the th century many parts of the Minnesota area were already well traveled by British and French explorers. Though the region s population was mostly Native American, there were important British trading posts in the area with many European and mixed race settlers, particularly in the north. Grand Portage, in particular, had long been established as the major trading center for the North West Company. David Thompson, a British fur trader for the North West Company of Montreal, completed numerous surveys and maps of the North American frontier. In he completed the first known map of the Minnesota area, in what was then the Northwest Territory. The Jay Treaty, however, obliged most of the British settlers to withdraw their settlements in, though mixed race peoples remained. In the th parallel was established as the boundary between the United States and British North America. However, the point where the Red River crossed this line was not marked until, when Stephen Long conducted a survey expedition. The expedition determined, among other things, that the fur trading post of Pembina lay just inside the U.S. border. In addition to these military bases, private companies operated numerous trading posts in the region that were often referred to as forts, though they typically had little in the way of defensive fortifications. From to employees of the Hudson s Bay Company and the North West Company engaged in various territorial conflicts known as the fur trade wars, including the famous Battle of Seven Oaks at what is now Winnipeg, Manitoba. As a result of these conflicts numerous Mtis migrated from the Red River area to central and eastern Minnesota, particularly in the vicinity of Saint Paul. This Red River Exodus became a major source of francophone immigration into Minnesota during the territorial era. The Mtis and other mixed race groups were often regarded as French Canadian whites rather than Indians. The most important commercial enterprise in the early part of the territorial era was the lucrative fur trade. At the beginning of the th century two British companies competed for dominance in the North American trade Hudson s Bay Company and the North West Company. The North West company had used Grand Portage as its western headquarters along with other smaller companies that operated in the area. Grand Portage was one of the four principal British trading and shipping points furs in North America. Following the Treaty of Paris, in, British operations at Grand Portage were technically illegal though the trade continued. However, beginning in the North West Company began re establishing its headquarters north of the border at the newly constructed Fort William in what is now Ontario. After Grand Portage had been reduced to a minor trading center and most traders eventually abandoned the area. In, the Hudson Bay Company, which had by then absorbed the North West Company, shipped out a final band of Ojibwe who were employed by the company. One of the major sources of income in the territory during the s was U.S. government annuity payments to the Ojibwe and other tribes required by earlier treaties. These payments amounted to more than, per year on average. million in present day terms compared to approximately, per year. million in present day terms given to the territory itself for development. Because of corruption, and mishandling of the payments to the tribes, a great deal of the money was used directly by U.S. settlers for commercial and community development with questionable benefit to the tribes. At the beginning of the Minnesota Territory, in fact, these payments were the territory s most important source of income since the fur trade was no longer as lucrative as it had once been and other exports were still negligible. Construction on Fort Snelling began in and was finished in. The Fort became a magnet for settlement in east central Minnesota. Nearby Mendota was established during the same period and, as the regional headquarters for the American Fur Company, also drew settlement in the area soon becoming Minnesota s commercial center. Many of the first stone buildings in the territory were constructed in Mendota by employees of the American Fur Company, which bought animal pelts at that location from to. By, treaties between Native American tribes and the U.S. government had opened much of Minnesota to U.S. settlement. Fort Snelling was no longer a frontier outpost. Efforts to establish Minnesota as a prominent future state in the Union were swift. In territorial legislature petitioned the U.S. Congress for land to build a railroad between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Saint Paul. That same year the legislature incorporated the University of Minnesota and established its endowment though the University would not admit students until many years later. The influx of settlers in the s transformed Minnesota from a sparsely populated territory of less than, white settlers and a significantly larger native population, to a substantial population center of over, predominantly European settlers. The city of Saint Paul expanded from less than people in to over in and over, in. Until the s the Native American population vastly outnumbered the population of European ancestry in the area. Nevertheless, the division between Indian and white during this era was always somewhat vague. In general persons of mixed descent were considered white if they dressed in European clothing and adopted European customs. Indians were those who lived in traditional native lifestyles. Even as the U.S. began to establish its authority over the region and some settlers from the U.S. began to arrive the Native American population continued to hold significant political and social influence as a result of the fur trade. As experienced hunters they were important to one of North America s major business enterprises. The decline of this trade during the later part of the era marked the decline of Native American influence. It is in fact likely that a very large percentage of the white population reported in the census was of partially Native American ancestry. Many men of mixed racial ancestry became respected members of white society. William W. Warren, for example, was the son of an American entrepreneur who hailed from New York before he began working in John Jacob Astor s American Fur Company and a mixed blood Ojibwe mother whose father had been in the old French and British fur trade was educated in the East and in the early s lived on the Upper Mississippi, in part working as an independent translator and Indian Agency contractor. Warren was a good writer his newspaper articles were eventually published as the only th century compendium of Ojibwe history and was elected to the territorial legislature before his death from consumption. The ordinance was nevertheless seen as ambiguous in that it did not specifically address the slaves already in the territories, and it discussed the free population of the territories seemingly implying that a slave population would exist. French traders in the territories, and later even American army officers including Josiah Snelling who commanded his namesake fort, continued to hold slaves with the blessings of many in Congress. Throughout the first half of the th century, the northeastern portion of the state was a part of the Northwest Territory, formed in. After Ohio s statehood the area became part of the new Illinois Territory in. After Illinois statehood the area was incorporated into the Michigan Territory in and later became part of the Wisconsin Territory in. The western and southern areas of the state were not formally organized until, when they became part of the Iowa Territory. Stephen A. Douglas D, the chair of the United States Senate Committee on Territories, drafted the bill authorizing the Minnesota Territory in. He had envisioned a future for the upper Mississippi valley, so he was motivated to keep the area from being carved up by neighboring territories. In, he had prevented Iowa from including Fort Snelling and Saint Anthony Falls within its northern border. In, he kept the organizers of Wisconsin from including Saint Paul and Saint Anthony Falls. The Minnesota Territory was established from the lands remaining from Iowa Territory and Wisconsin Territory on March,. The Minnesota Territory extended far into what is now North Dakota and South Dakota, to the Missouri River. There was a dispute over the shape of the state to be carved out of Minnesota Territory. An alternate proposal that was only narrowly defeated would have made the th parallel the state s northern border and the Missouri River its western border, thus giving up the whole northern half of the state in exchange for the eastern half of what later became South Dakota. Alexander Ramsey W became the first governor of Minnesota Territory and Henry Hastings Sibley D became the territorial delegate to the United States Congress. Henry M. Rice D, who replaced Sibley as the territorial delegate in, worked in Congress to promote Minnesota interests. He lobbied for the construction of a railroad connecting Saint Paul and Lake Superior, with a link from Saint Paul to the Illinois Central Railroad. In December, Rice brought forward two bills in Congress an enabling act that would allow Minnesota to form a state constitution, and a railroad land grant bill. The enabling act defined a state containing both prairie and forest lands with the boundaries drawn as they are today. The bid for statehood came at a time when North South tensions in the U.S. were rising, tensions that would later lead to the American Civil War. Debate over admitting Minnesota as a free state was heated, but the enabling act was finally passed on February,. Maeda was fundamental to the development of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, including through his teaching of Carlos Gracie and others of the Gracie family. He was also a promoter of Japanese emigration to Brazil. Maeda won more than, professional fights in his career. His accomplishments led to him being called the toughest man who ever lived and being referred to as the father of Brazilian Jiu jitsu. Tomita, Maeda, and Satake sailed from Yokohama on November, and arrived in New York City on December,. In any event, later that year the US Military Academy hired a former world champion professional wrestler, Tom Jenkins, instead of a judo teacher, a job Jenkins kept until his retirement in. Maeda was fond of the name and started using it to promote his art thereafter. Many etymological suggestions have been made, though there is no general agreement You may be a fox, Ono called after her, but you are the mother of my son and I love you. Come back when you please you will always be welcome. So every evening she stole back and slept in his arms. The fox later saves his life by leading him past a band of armed robbers. My father lived here before me, sir, and by now I have many children and grandchildren. They get into a lot of mischief, I m afraid, and I m always after them to stop, but they never listen. And now, sir, you re understandably fed up with us. I gather that you re going to kill us all. But I just want you to know, sir, how sorry I am that this is our last night of life. Won t you pardon us, one more time, If we ever make trouble again, then of course you must act as you think best. But the young ones, sir I m sure they ll understand when I explain to them why you re so upset.

After the Webber Avenue intersection, NY turns to the northeast, where it passes the athletic fields of Sleepy Hollow High School. NY intersects with Sleepy Hollow Road, which leads into a residential development and parallels NY northeastward for a short distance. A request by the state to dismiss the suit was denied in August, and the case was eventually heard by the state Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile. km of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July, the court ruled in favor of the Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY was completed in the early s, and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY. The entire route is in Westchester County. Hurricane Tanya was the final storm of the very active Atlantic hurricane season. The twenty first tropical cyclone, nineteenth named storm, and eleventh hurricane of the season, Tanya developed from a tropical wave while well north of the Lesser Antilles on October. The system headed northeastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Tanya on October. Tanya meandered around the central Atlantic, and further intensified into a hurricane on October. Thereafter, Tanya tracked northeastward before curving to the east northeast. After switching to an eastward direction, Tanya weakened to a tropical storm on November. Later that day, Tanya passed through the Azores as it was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Throughout the Azores, the extratropical remnants of Tanya produced high winds. As a result, extensive property damage occurred, which included destroyed or damaged houses, and sunken boats there were also reports of significant damage to agriculture. However, an exact damage toll figure in unknown. In addition, there was one fatality and several injuries. Hurricane Tanya was the first storm to be designated with a name starting with T since naming of Atlantic tropical cyclones began in. Sweet Love is a song by American recording artist Chris Brown, taken from his fifth studio album, Fortune. It was written by Brown, Cory Marks, Greg Curtis, Jamal Polow da Don Jones, Jason JP Perry and Tommy Doyle Jr., while the production was handled by Polow da Don and Perry. The song was sent to urban contemporary radio in the United States on April, as the second single from the album. Sweet Love is a slow jam R B ballad which incorporates elements of electronic music. The lyrics of the song revolve around Brown asking his lover to take off her clothes so that they can have sex. In the United States, Sweet Love debuted at number on the Hot R B Hip Hop Songs chart in the issue dated April,. After spending weeks ascending the chart, Sweet Love peaked at number in the issue dated July,. The song remained on the chart for a total of weeks. On the Billboard Hot, Sweet Love debuted and peaked at number in the issue dated May,. Digital download Sweet Love Credits adapted from the liner notes for Fortune The kakapo is primarily nocturnal it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night. Young birds indulge in play fighting, and one bird will often lock the neck of another under its chin. The kakapo is curious by nature and has been known to interact with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kakapo, which have distinct personalities. The kakapo is the only species of flightless parrot in the world, and the only flightless bird that has a lek breeding system. Males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females. Females listen to the males as they display, or lek. They choose a mate based on the quality of his display they are not pursued by the males in any overt way. No pair bond is formed males and females meet only to mate. Females are attracted by the booms of the competing males they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one of the males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for to minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female. Beginning in the s, European settlers cleared vast tracts of land for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. Europeans knew little of the kakapo until George Gray of the British Museum described it from a skin in. As the Mori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kakapo. In the late th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before the bird became extinct. In, the Kakapo Recovery Programme presented a new management plan that would run from to. The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least by, increase genetic diversity, maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support. During the summer breeding season, the total population of kakapo rose to over for the first time since monitoring began, reaching by February. Twenty two of the chicks had to be hand reared because of a shortage of food on Codfish Island. In, seven kakapo were transferred to Little Barrier Island, in an attempt to establish a successful breeding programme. Kakapo were last on the island in. Despite this, the kakapo was also regarded as an affectionate pet by the Mori. This was corroborated by European settlers in New Zealand in the th century, among them George Edward Grey, who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet kakapo s behaviour towards him and his friends was more like that of a dog than a bird. Live Kicking is a BBC Saturday morning children s magazine programme, running from to. The fourth in a succession of Saturday morning shows, it was the replacement for Going Live, and took many of its features from it, such as phone ins, games, comedy, competitions and the showing of cartoons. Once Live Kicking had become established in series two, it reached its height in popularity during series four, when it was presented by Zo Ball and Jamie Theakston their final episode won a BAFTA award. After this the series ratings dropped with the launch of SMTV Live on ITV and was eventually cancelled in. Andi Peters expressed his intention to move on in March, and Emma Forbes decided to follow after finding out she was pregnant. The Simpsons X Men Smart Guy Timothy Henry Hoolulu Pitman March, February, was an American Union Army soldier of Native Hawaiian descent. Considered one of the Hawaii Sons of the Civil War, he was among a group of more than one hundred documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii born combatants who fought in the American Civil War while the Kingdom of Hawaii was still an independent nation. For a period of time after the end of the war, the legacy and contributions of Pitman and other documented Hawaiian participants in the American Civil War were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians. However, there has been a revival of interest in recent years in the Hawaiian community. In, these Hawaii Sons of the Civil War were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. Growing into adolescence, he was said to strongly resemble his Hawaiian mother. Robert G. Carter gave a brief description of his appearance in wartime letters first published in Considering him missing, Pitman s regiment did not discover his final fate until news of his funeral at Roxbury was received in the spring of the following year. His remains were returned to his family in Massachusetts after his death in Parole Camp. Benjamin Pitman, his father, had him buried in a family plot in Mount Auburn Cemetery. On one side of the Pitman family grave marker was placed the inscription Timothy Henry Pitman Born at Hilo, Hawaii Died at Camp Parole battles of South Mountain, Antietam and sent to Camp Parole, Annapolis, and died in camp of pneumonia. The dome, octagonal in shape, stands prominently on top of the centre of the cella. It was supported by four now destroyed columns which were located directly beneath it. The integrated bell tower has been built on top of the narthex, as was customary in contemporary Byzantine church architecture, and extends from the rectangular main structure. The bell tower was originally rectangular, though it is now partially ruined. It was reached from the south by means of a stone staircase. In addition to the guest stars returning from the previous arc episodes, or the episode Home, Jeffrey Combs returned as Shran. The episode was shot across seven days using mostly standing sets, with only an Andorian brig built specifically for this episode. Kir Shara also saw the return of the Vulcan lirpa, a weapon which had been first introduced in the Star Trek The Original Series episode Amok Time. The episode originally aired on December, on UPN. It received a Nielsen rating of. percent, which equalled the highest ratings seen during the fourth season. It was warmly received by critics who praised Combs performance and noted that this episode was an indication of the improving quality of the series. However there was mixed opinion regarding the ending of the episode. Warren is a poet, and the author of two books, including Mi Base side orn Pitcairn My Favourite Place on Pitcairn, written with children on Pitcairn Island. It is the first book written and published in Pitkern and English. Pitcairn has a small population. The island s residents often serve in several capacities or jobs. Warren describes her many roles on her personal website As the case wore on, Warren reflected that the bottom had fallen out of our world We lost our trust for each other. Her brother, Jay Warren, who was accused of indecent assault, was the only defendant among the seven accused to be acquitted on October.

The final stages of fighting between the Nationalists and the Communists, in the Chinese Civil War also known as the War of Liberation, occurred between and. When the fighting escalated, the nd Battalion, th Marines were ordered to Northern China to evacuate all Americans. This mission was accomplished by March and after which the battalion was sent to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and was renamed as the rd Battalion, th Marine. On May, barely two weeks after the fall of Saigon, Khmer Rouge forces seized a U.S. flagged merchant ship, the SS Mayaguez in recognized international sea lanes claimed as territorial waters by Cambodia and removed its crew for questioning. The Khmer Rouge naval forces used abandoned US Navy Swift Boats in the seizure of the U.S. container ship.

A unit citation or commendation is an award bestowed upon an organization for the action cited. Members of the unit who participated in said actions are allowed to wear on their uniforms the awarded unit citation. has been presented with the following awards A topological ordering of a directed graph is an ordering of its vertices into a sequence, such that for every edge the start vertex of the edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of the edge. A graph that has a topological ordering cannot have any cycles, because the edge into the earliest vertex of a cycle would have to be oriented the wrong way. Therefore, every graph with a topological ordering is acyclic. Conversely, every directed acyclic graph has a topological ordering. Therefore, this property can be used as an alternative definition of the directed acyclic graphs they are exactly the graphs that have topological orderings. The transitive reduction of a DAG G is the graph with the fewest edges that represents the same reachability relation as G. It is a subgraph of G, formed by discarding the edges u v for which G also contains a longer path connecting the same two vertices. Like the transitive closure, the transitive reduction is uniquely defined for DAGs. In contrast, for a directed graph that is not acyclic, there can be more than one minimal subgraph with the same reachability relation. Every directed acyclic graph has a topological ordering, an ordering of the vertices such that the starting endpoint of every edge occurs earlier in the ordering than the ending endpoint of the edge. The existence of such an ordering can be used to characterize DAGs a directed graph is a DAG if and only if it has a topological ordering. In general, this ordering is not unique a DAG has a unique topological ordering if and only if it has a directed path containing all the vertices, in which case the ordering is the same as the order in which the vertices appear in the path. The family of topological orderings of a DAG is the same as the family of linear extensions of the reachability relation for the DAG, so any two graphs representing the same partial order have the same set of topological orders. These numbers may be computed by the recurrence relation A directed acyclic graph may be used to represent a network of processing elements. In this representation, data enters a processing element through its incoming edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges.

Fowler was unable to sustain his goal a game ratio throughout the season, but finished his first season as the club s leading scorer with goals in all competitions, although Ian Rush had scored more goals in the league. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League without making any impact in any of the major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment of Roy Evans as successor built up hope for the future. Stan Collymore, Fowler s strike partner from to, said in his autobiography that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore were among the most prolific goal scoring strike partnerships in England during the season. In the same season he scored twice in a victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first FA Cup final that season, but was on the losing side as Manchester United won. Fowler received a call up to the full England squad and won his first cap on March as a substitute in a friendly against Bulgaria. His first start at international level was against Croatia which was the England game following his substitute appearance. Fowler was part of the England squad for Euro, making two appearances in the tournament. On December, he scored four against Middlesbrough, including his hundredth for Liverpool. This meant he reached a century of goals one game quicker than his first strike partner, Ian Rush, in just games. Fowler s performance in the football season was marred by a knee ligament injury that kept him out of action for half the season and caused him to miss the World Cup. During this period of injury, fellow Liverpool striker, Michael Owen rose to prominence, making his debut in. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler s absence. The season was Fowler s most successful season. He appeared in three finals, scoring goals and lifting three trophies in a unique cup treble. In the absence of Jamie Redknapp, who was sidelined by injury, Fowler was named as Liverpool captain when he started. However he found himself the third choice Liverpool striker, with Houllier favouring a forward partnership of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey. The transfer went ahead just one month after his hat trick at Leicester. He made his Leeds debut in an away game against Fulham in December, the same ground where he had made his Liverpool debut eight years earlier. Fowler scored goals in the remainder of the season, helping Leeds to a UEFA Cup qualifying place. Fowler was included in the England squad for the World Cup, but only made one appearance, coming on as substitute in a second round win over Denmark. Fowler had injury problems at the start of the season and rarely featured when fit, making just two substitute appearances in the first four months of the season. His first start of the season came against Scunthorpe United in the FA Cup on January, in which he scored a hat trick. The following week he scored Manchester City s third goal in their win against local rivals Manchester United after coming on as substitute. However, Fowler made only one more appearance for Manchester City before returning to Liverpool on a free transfer. On January, Fowler rejoined Liverpool from Manchester City on a free transfer, signing a contract until the end of the season. Fowler had remained a Liverpool fan after he left the club he was in the Istanbul crowd when Liverpool won the Champions League in. On January, it was announced that Fowler could miss the rest of the season for Cardiff after his hip operation revealed that the injury was worse than previously thought. Surgeons were forced to perform a micro fracture in order for the hip to heal properly. Despite this, he attempted to make a comeback at the end of the season to play in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth and was included in the man match squad. He did not feature in the game in and thus did not receive a runners up medal having not made an appearance in the competition. His three month deal at Blackburn expired on December, and after not being offered a new contract was released by the club, he entered talks with new Australian A League club North Queensland Fury. Shortly after his arrival in Australia, it was reported in the British media that Fowler would be making a swift return to his homeland and sign for League One side Tranmere Rovers, who had just appointed Fowler s former Liverpool team mate John Barnes as manager. However, Fowler was quick to dismiss talk of a quick return to England. When Barnes was dismissed three months later, it was reported that Tranmere had approached Fowler about becoming player manager, but these reports too were dismissed. On June, Fowler played in his first competitive game for England in nearly three years, starting in the draw with Bulgaria during Euro qualifying. Kevin Keegan named Fowler in the preliminary squad for Euro, and after featuring in the three warm up games against Brazil, Ukraine, and Malta, he was named in the final squad on June. Fowler did not play in the tournament as England were eliminated in the group stages. On returning to England, Fowler has worked with League One side Milton Keynes Dons on an ad hoc basis to assist the club s coaching staff. On April, Bury confirmed that Fowler would join their coaching staff for one week to assist Richie Barker. Fowler briefly coached Liverpool s strikers in April.

It follows the poet s contemplation of a morning spent in idleness. Three figures are presented Ambition, Love and Poesy dressed in placid sandals and white robes. The narrator examines each using a series of questions and statements on life and art. The poem concludes with the narrator giving up on having all three of the figures as part of his life. Some critics regard Ode on Indolence as inferior to the other four odes. Others suggest that the poem exemplifies a continuity of themes and imagery characteristic of his more widely read works, and provides valuable biographical insight into his poetic career. The poem relies on a first person narration style similar to Ode to Psyche. It begins with a classical scene from an urn in a similar manner to Ode on a Grecian Urn, but the scene in Indolence is allegorical. The opening describes three figures that operate as three fates With bowed necks, and joined hands, side faced In placid sandals, and in white robes graced They pass d, like figures on a marble urn When shifted round to see the other side They came again, as, when the urn once more Is shifted round, the first seen shades return The figures remain mysterious as they circle around the narrator. Eventually they turn towards him and it is revealed that they are Ambition, Love, and Poesy, the themes of the poem A third time pass d they by, and, passing, turn d Then faded, and to follow them I burn d The first was a fair Maid, and Love her name The second was Ambition, pale of cheek, The last, whom I love more, the more of blame I knew to be my demon Poesy. Lines And for that poor Ambition it springs From a man s little heart s short fever fit For Poesy, no, she has not a joy, O, for an age so shelter d from annoy, That I may never know how change the moons, Or hear the voice of busy common sense, lines A pet lamb in a sentimental farce, And for the day faint visions there is store Into the clouds, and never more return, lines The classical influences Keats invoked affected other Romantic poets, but his odes contain a higher degree of allusion than most of his contemporaries works. As for the main theme, indolence and poetry, the poem reflects the emotional state of being Keats describes in an early letter to his brother George Erving Goffman June November was a Canadian American sociologist and writer, considered the most influential American sociologist of the twentieth century. In he was listed by The Times Higher Education Guide as the sixth most cited author in the humanities and social sciences, behind Anthony Giddens and ahead of Jrgen Habermas. Goffman is sometimes credited with having in coined the term total institution, though Fine and Manning note that he had heard it in lectures by Everett Hughes in reference to any type of institution in which people are treated alike and in which behavior is regulated. Regardless of whether Goffman coined the term total institution, he popularized it with his book, Asylums Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates. The book has been described as ethnography of the concept of the total institution. The book was one of the first sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients in psychiatric hospitals and a major contribution to understanding of social aspects of mental illness. Frame Analysis An Essay on the Organization of Experience is Goffman s attempt to explain how conceptual frames ways to organize experience structure an individual s perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame is a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame a person uses the frame which represents structure to hold together his picture which represents the content of what he is experiencing in his life. Goffman saw this book as his magnum opus, but it was not as popular as his earlier works. The Frame Analyses of Talk Gender Advertisements is a book that, as part of Goffman s series of studies in the anthropology of visual communication, deals with the topic of gender representation in advertising. The book is a visual essay about sex roles in advertising, differences in the depictions of men and women and the subtle, underlying messages about the sexual roles projected by masculine and feminine images in advertising, as well as and symbolism in advertising. In the book Goffman examined over advertisements in order to find general patterns in stereotypical gender representation, which he placed into six categories Relative Size Goffman argues that social situation is expressed through the relative size of the persons in the advertisements, with men showing their superiority through their girth and height. The Family When families are depicted in advertising, parents are shown to be closer to their children of the same gender and in some instances men are shown separate from the rest of the family, in a protective manner. In his career, Goffman worked at the University of Chicago, Division of Social Sciences, Chicago assistant, resident associate, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland visiting scientist, University of California, Berkeley assistant professor, professor, professor of sociology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and Sociology,.

Lead vocals Beyonc Knowles, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams Audio mastering Tom Coyne Guitarist Tim Stewart Marshall Herff Applewhite, Jr. May, March, also known as Bo and Do, among other names, was an American cult leader who founded what became known as the Heaven s Gate religious group and organized their mass suicide in claiming the lives of thirty nine people. A native of Texas, Applewhite attended several universities and, as a young man, served in the United States Army. After finishing school at Austin College, he taught music at the University of Alabama. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as the chair of the music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. He left the school in, citing emotional turmoil. His father s death a year later brought on severe depression. In, he developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while, and then began to travel around the U.S. in to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology. Marshall Herff Applewhite was born in Spur, Texas, on May, to Marshall Herff Applewhite Sr. and his wife Louise ne Winfield he had three siblings. The son of a Presbyterian minister, Applewhite became very religious as a child. Applewhite moved to New York City in an unsuccessful attempt to launch a professional singing career upon finishing his education in Colorado. He then taught at the University of Alabama. He lost his position there after pursuing a sexual relationship with a male student his religious education was likely not supportive of same sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires. He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in, and they divorced three years later. Applewhite believed in the ancient astronaut hypothesis, which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in the past and placed humans on Earth and would return to collect a select few. Parts of this teaching bear similarities to the Reformed Christian concept of election, likely owing to Applewhite s Presbyterian upbringing. He often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from Star Trek and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show. Applewhite and Nettles sometimes made sudden, drastic changes to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as a way that they increased their students devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite s approval, which he used to control them. Applewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as he needed the guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured that there would be no possibility of the group s continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group s previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite s role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority. While covering the suicides, several media outlets focused on Applewhite s sexuality the New York Post dubbed him the Gay Guru. Gay rights activist Troy Perry argued that Applewhite s repression, and society s rejection, of same sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide. This idea has failed to gain support among academics. Zeller argues that Applewhite s sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism, which he believes resulted from a variety of factors, though he grants sexuality a role. As the war years went, the newspaper s finances gradually improved. The Norwegian state became more active in production and trade and contributed many advertisements. Demokraten acquired its own type setting machine in October and a printing press in, which it used from January. From July, circulation once again increased to six days a week. Reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience, and have since listed it as one of the greatest games of all time. Journey won several game of the year awards and received several other awards and nominations, including a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media nomination for the Grammy Awards. A retail Collector s Edition, including Journey, Thatgamecompany s two previous titles, and additional media, was released on August,. The game was released digitally for the PlayStation on July, and a physical edition was released on October,. Journey was the last game made under a three game contract between Thatgamecompany and Sony, the first two being Flow and Flower. Development of the game began in, after the release of Thatgamecompany s previous title Flower. The person development team for Journey was composed mainly of creators of the company s previous games co founder Jenova Chen was the creative director and Nick Clark returned as lead designer. Kellee Santiago, producer of Flow and Flower, did not reprise her duties, concentrating instead on her role as the company s president, and was replaced by Robin Hunicke. The stress of the project led to the feeling there was not enough time or money to complete everything the team wished to, which added to the stress and caused arguments about the design of the game. The developers ended up reducing the overtime they spent on the project to avoid burning out, though it meant further delays and risked the company running out of money as the game neared completion. In a speech at the th annual D.I.C.E. Awards in, Chen admitted that the company had indeed been driven to bankruptcy in the final months of development, and that some of the developers had gone unpaid at the time. Hunicke described the solution to finally finishing the game as learning to let go of tensions and ideas that could not make it into the game and be nice to each other. The soundtrack was nominated for the Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards, the first video game soundtrack to be nominated for that category, though it did not win. Additionally, the game won the award for best music and was nominated for the best graphics award from IGN, and was selected as the best PlayStation Network game by GameSpot. At the Spike Video Game Awards, Journey won awards as the best PlayStation game, the best indie game, and the game with the best music, and was additionally nominated for game of the year, best downloadable game, best graphics, and best song in a game for I Was Born For This. It received the Annie Award for video game animation. It won five awards at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards Artistic Achievement, Audio Achievement, Game Design, Online Multiplayer and Original Music, and was nominated for Best Game, Game Innovation and Story. In March, it won six awards at the annual Game Developers Choice Awards Best Audio, Best Game Design, Best Visual Arts, Best Downloadable Game, the Innovation Award, and Game of the Year. The few criticisms for the game centered on its length and pacing. Clements noted that not all players would appreciate a game with a deliberate, melancholic pace and short duration, comments echoed by the Edge review. Miller noted the lack of a complex gameplay elements in Journey, and Shaw was disappointed that the game was only a few hours long, though Douglas said the length was perfect. Miller concluded the game could be compared to a musical concert, a well directed film, or a long awaited book, while Clements concluded, completing Journey will create memories that last for years.

The marriage produced four children Lady Sybil Primrose, born in Lady Margaret Primrose, born in the heir Harry Primrose, Lord Dalmeny later th Earl of Rosebery, born in and finally the Honourable Neil Primrose, born the same year as his elder brother. More revealing is a comment Lady Rosebery herself made to her husband, I sometimes think it is wrong that I have thought less of the children in comparison to you shortly before her death in, suggesting that when a choice between her children and husband was forced on her, she always chose her husband. However, the same comment also hints that she was not unaware that her choice was at the cost of her children.

The track was subject to controversy, following reports that Jennifer Lopez and Tommy Mottola Carey s ex husband stole the idea of sampling the singer s original planned sample, Yellow Magic Orchestra s Firecracker, over a month after Carey had signed for it. Since Carey s Glitter was to be released over a month after Lopez s album, she changed the song s melody to sample from Candy instead. Controversy ensued following its release Carey was hospitalized for severe mental and physical exhaustion, following poorly received television appearances involving the song and album. After the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly when she posted the letters. Two days later on July, she was suddenly hospitalized, citing extreme exhaustion and a physical and emotional breakdown. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey s publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records and th Century Fox delayed the release of both the film s soundtrack and the film itself for three weeks from August to September and from August to September, respectively. Following Carey s absence from the public eye, as well as her abandonment of promotional appearances for the film and soundtrack, her unprecedented million five album record deal with Virgin Records EMI Records was bought out for million. The decision was brought out due to the low sales of the project, as well as the negative publicity surrounding her breakdown. Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year. Additionally, she founded her own label modeled after her initials, MonarC Entertainment, and signed a new three album record deal with Island Records, valued at over million. At the time of the single s release, Carey did not perform Loverboy live. The first performance of the song came years later, on Carey s Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour in. Prior to Virgin s release of Loverboy, Carey halted all promotional appearances corresponding to the song. Citing an emotional breakdown and a subsequent hospitalization, Carey remained out of the public eye for several weeks. After its release, Loverboy failed to garner strong charting on prominent international markets, and received poor radio airplay throughout the United States. Loverboy peaked atop the Billboard s Hot Singles Sales chart for four consecutive weeks, though due to weak airplay, managed to reach number two on the Billboard Hot with Bootylicious by Destiny s Child holding it back from the top position.

Bosnian Allah Maltese Alla Turkish Allah Many Arabic type fonts feature special ligatures for Allah. The song was played only once and received minor treatments afterwards, with the addition of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song s length. Eno was outraged that U wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, These fucking guys, they re supposed to be so spiritual they don t spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. Nothing like that ever happened to me in the studio in my whole life. The band s original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, Moment of Surrender is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.

The sexes may be distinguished by the length of the teeth in relation to the total length of the body approximately for males and for females. Adults, especially females, are very heavy and stout. One female had the following dimensions If threatened, they may hiss loudly as a warning, doing so in a deep and steady rhythm, slightly flattening the head at the expiration of each breath. Despite this, they are unlikely to strike unless severely provoked however, they are one of fastest striking snakes in the world, so care should be taken in handling them. The Sixth Extinction is the first episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series The X Files. It was first shown on the Fox network on November, in the United States. The episode was written by Chris Carter and directed by Kim Manners. The Sixth Extinction earned a Nielsen household rating of., being watched by. million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Scully, with Dr. Barnes help, is able to translate some of the spaceship, which contains information on genetics and various religions. Dr. Barnes behavior becomes increasingly erratic however and, armed with a machete, he refuses to let Scully or Ngebe leave. He soon realizes that the craft is bringing dead fish back to life, and Scully and Ngebe take the opportunity to knock him out and escape. Scully sees the vanishing man again in the car as they drive off. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode s origins, We ve destroyed all the stuff about Mulder s father, the project, and the Syndicate. All the things that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time we sat down to write a mythology show, we knew it was going to be a completely different challenge. Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating I felt that, with The Sixth Extinction, I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to Amor Fati, which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder s choices in life. Snow is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Kanata Izumo. Much of its gameplay is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story s narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Kanata is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. Miss Meyers March was an American Quarter Horse racehorse and broodmare, the World Champion Quarter Running Horse. She won, equivalent to about, as of as well as races. As a broodmare, she produced, or was the mother of, the first American Quarter Horse Association AQHA Supreme Champion, Kid Meyers.

She was inducted into the AQHA s American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in. Far Away Places is split into three vignettes that take place almost entirely during a single day following the characters Peggy, Roger, and Don. Weiner spoke about the structure of the episode in June He spoke about the writing of a scene of the episode in August I had, in the writers room, given this speech about Ginsberg saying he was a Martian. I delivered it as Ginsberg. We knew that Peggy s story was going to climax with that, and it was going to be their great moment of intimacy he would distract her from her failure and bond with her in that strange way that people who feel separate do. Then, when we were writing the draft, I got the notes from the room, and the speech was like one sentence. We searched everywhere, and it turned out I had never pitched more than that one sentence I m a Martian. I had a great version of it, but it turned out it had all been in my head in one way or another. It all had to come from scratch. Once I reduced the panic and tried to re create it, it did happen. So, to me, it still has a magical quality to it. Editor Christopher Gay spoke about the episode in August The episode was viewed by. million viewers on the night of its original airing. It drew. million viewers in the demographic. Far Away Places was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Single Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series. Elements of the plot of the episode were compared by executive producer to the Protestant Reformation with the Vulcan High Command representing the Catholic Church. The producers took care to cast actors in the roles of T Pau and Surak who looked similar to the actors who portrayed those parts in The Original Series. Nielsen ratings for the first run of the episode saw a decrease from the first part of the trilogy, down to.. The critical response was mixed, saying that whilst they were entertained by the episode, there were several elements in the plot which were problematic. Filming started on September, and concentrated on Enterprise ship scenes on the standing sets for the first two days. After that production moved to the cave sets, which were dressed with Vulcan artifacts. On the fourth day of production, those artifacts were removed so that the same sets could use used to film the visions that Archer has of Surak. All exterior scenes in the Vulcan desert like Forge were shot on a soundstage. The final day of filming took place on October, when all the scenes set in the Vulcan High Command were filmed. These involved only Foxworth, Graham and Rubinstein as well as a handful of extras. The first home media release of The Forge was in the season four DVD box set of Enterprise, originally released in the United States on November,. The Blu ray edition was released on April,. In Zambia, mole crickets are thought to bring good fortune, while in Latin America they are said to predict rain. In Florida, where Scapteriscus mole crickets are non native, they are considered pests, and various biological controls have been used. Gryllotalpa species have been used as food in West Java, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Within these subfamilies, genera include Gryllotalpa Neocurtilla Scapteriscus Neoscapteriscus Adults of most species of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females typically take wing soon after sunset, and are attracted to areas where males are calling, which they do for about an hour after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity. Mole crickets live almost entirely below ground, digging tunnels of different kinds for the major functions of life, including feeding, escape from predators, attracting a mate by singing, mating, and raising of young. Males attract mates by constructing specially shaped tunnels in which they sing. Mating takes place in the male s burrow the male may widen a tunnel to make room for the female to mount, though in some species mating is tail to tail. Females lay their eggs either in their normal burrows or in specially dug brood chambers which are sealed when complete in the case of the genus Neoscapteriscus or not sealed in the case of genera Gryllotalpa and Neocurtilla. Mole crickets are relatively common, but because they are nocturnal and spend nearly all their lives underground in extensive tunnel systems, they are rarely seen. They inhabit agricultural fields and grassy areas. They are present in every continent with the exception of Antarctica by, one hundred and seven species had been described and more species are likely to be discovered, especially in Asia. Neoscapteriscus didactylus is a widespread pest species, originating in South America it has spread to the West Indies and New South Wales in Australia. Gryllotalpa africana is a major pest in South Africa other Gryllotalpa species are widely distributed in Europe, Asia and Australia. They are native to Britain as to western Europe, but the former population of G. gryllotalpa may now be extinct in mainland Britain, surviving in the Channel Islands. Maryland Route MD is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs. miles. km from MD in Ceresville north to the Pennsylvania state line near Taneytown, where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route PA toward Hanover. MD is the main highway between Frederick and Hanover the state highway connects the towns of Walkersville and Woodsboro in northeastern Frederick County with Keymar and Taneytown in northwestern Carroll County. MD was blazed as a migration route in the th century and a pair of turnpikes in Frederick County in the th century, one of which was the last private toll road in Maryland. The state highway, which was originally designated MD, was built as a modern highway in Frederick County in the mid s and constructed as Francis Scott Key Highway in Carroll County in the late s and early s. MD received its modern route number in as part of a three route number swap. The state highway s bypasses of Walkersville and Woodsboro opened in the early s and mid s, respectively. MD received a new steel I beam bridge over Big Pipe Creek in this bridge was replaced in. The state highway was widened through Taneytown in. MD s present steel I beam bridge over Little Pipe Creek at the county line was started in and completed in along with mile. km of approach roads. The state highway was reconstructed and widened from the Little Pipe Creek Bridge to New Midway in and. Reconstruction of the highway commenced from New Midway to Woodsboro in, from Woodsboro to Ceresville in, and from Taneytown to the Pennsylvania state line in. MD F was the designation for an unnamed. mile. km connector between MD and former MD D. MD F and MD D were removed from the state highway system in due to the roadway being overgrown. That evening Napoleon and the four merchants discussed the revolution, subsequent rebellions, and their consequences. Speaking as a pro Republican, Napoleon supported the Jacobin cause, and explained the benefits of the revolution, whilst defending Carteaux s actions in Avignon. One of the merchants from Marseille expressed his moderate views regarding the revolution, and reasons for supporting civil war against a central government. The merchant stressed that Marseille did not fight for the Royalist cause, but opposed the nature of the Convention itself, condemning its decrees and deeming the execution of citizens as unlawful. Napoleon concluded that the people of Marseille should reject counter revolutionary ideals and adopt the constitution of the French Republic in order to end the civil war and allow the regular army to restore France. Shortly after the events, possibly on the July whilst still in Beaucaire, Napoleon wrote a political pamphlet titled Le souper de Beaucaire The supper at Beaucaire in which a soldier speaks with four merchants and sympathetic to their opinions attempts to dissipate their counter revolutionary sentiments. The quick collapse of the Liao led to more negotiations between the Song and the Jin. Jurchen military success and their effective control over the Sixteen Prefectures gave them more leverage. Aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures the Song still intended to seize most of the prefectures. In the spring of the two sides finally set the terms of the first Song Jin treaty. Only seven prefectures including Yanjing would be returned to the Song, and the Song would pay an annual indemnity of, packs of silk and, taels of silver to the Jin, as well as a one time payment of one million strings of copper coins to compensate the Jurchens for the tax revenue they would have earned had they not returned the prefectures. In May Tong Guan and the Song armies entered the looted Yanjing. On October, after about a year of negotiations, the Treaty of Shaoxing was ratified, ending the conflict between the Jin and the Song. By the terms of the treaty, the Huai River, north of the Yangtze, was designated as the boundary between the two empires. The Song agreed to pay a yearly tribute of, taels of silver and, packs of silk to the Jin. The treaty reduced the Southern Song s status to that of a Jin vassal. The document designated the Song as the insignificant state, while the Jin was recognized as the superior state. The text of the treaty has not survived in Chinese records, a sign of its humiliating reputation. The contents of the agreement were recovered from a Jurchen biography. Once the treaty had been settled, the Jurchens retreated north and trade resumed between the two empires. The peace ensured by the Shaoxing treaty lasted for the next seventy years, but was interrupted twice. One campaign was initiated by the Song and the other by the Jin. The T Howitzer Motor Carriage HMC was a United States Army self propelled gun used in World War II. Its design was based on requirements for an assault gun issued by the Armored Force in and it was built as an interim solution until a fully tracked design was complete. The T HMC entered service in November, seeing action for the first time in the North African Campaign. In the st Armored Division, each armored regiment was issued twelve Ts. Of these, three were used in each battalion headquarters platoon and three were used in each regimental reconnaissance platoon. In addition, the th and st Armored Infantry Regiments were each issued with nine T HMCs, with three of them being allocated to the headquarters platoon in each armored infantry battalion. Memory Almost Full reached the Top in both the UK and US, as well as Denmark, Sweden, Greece, and Norway. The Grammy nominated album has sold over million copies worldwide and has been certified gold by the RIAA for shipments of over, copies just in the United States. The album was released in three versions a single disc, a CD set, and a CD DVD deluxe edition, the latter of which was released on November. Many songs from Memory Almost Full were from a group of songs, which also included songs from Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, and some intended for the former nearly ended up on the latter. Any songs that were started, but not finished, for Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, McCartney didn t want to re do for Memory Almost Full. As sessions for the album progressed McCartney wrote some more songs, something that McCartney used to do when he was in the Beatles. A song called Perfect Lover was recorded at either one of the three following studios RAK Studios, AIR Studios or Ocean Way Studios sometime between November and April. Perfect Lover, in its original form was more folk like, similar to Chaos and Creation in the Backyard s Friends to Go. Perfect Lover went through a minor lyrical change, the bridge was changed, and an overhaul of its musical arrangement, before it finally became Ever Present Past. Two years after the session, sessions for the album started again. The book Paul McCartney Recording Sessions. A Journey Through Paul McCartney s Songs After The Beatles reports that the recordings of the album were started in September October and resumed in February at Abbey Road, with other sessions taking place between March and February. On November, the album was re released as Memory Almost Full Deluxe Edition. The set included one CD and one DVD. The CD included the standard album plus the three extra songs from the CD edition. The DVD contained five tracks recorded live at The Electric Ballroom in London, and two music videos. All songs written by Paul McCartney.

Memory Almost Full has been nominated in the following categories Best Pop Vocal Album for Memory Almost Full Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for Dance Tonight Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for Only Mama Knows Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for That Was Me Notes On the article that Concord Music Group posted on their official site in February a month before Memory Almost Full was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, Hear Music announced that shipments of the album reached a platinum status in the US. The label also claimed that the album gained a gold in other countries like Norway, though International Federation of the Phonographic Industry has not certified the album at any label there as of. On January, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation named Imagine the greatest song in the past years as voted by listeners on the show Tracks. The song ranked number on the Recording Industry Association of America s list of the Songs of the Century bearing the most historical significance. Virgin Radio conducted a UK favourite song survey in December, and listeners voted Imagine number one. Australians selected it the greatest song of all time on the Nine Network s to countdown show on September. They voted it eleventh in the youth radio network Triple J s Hottest Of All Time on July. Authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen criticised the song s instrumental music as overly sentimental and melodramatic, comparing it to the music of the pre rock era and describing the vocal melody as understated. According to Blaney, Lennon s lyrics describe hypothetical possibilities that offer no practical solutions lyrics that are at times nebulous and contradictory, asking the listener to abandon political systems while encouraging one similar to communism. Author Chris Ingham indicated the hypocrisy in Lennon, the millionaire rock star living in a mansion, encouraging listeners to imagine living their lives without possessions. Others argue that Lennon intended the song s lyrics to inspire listeners to imagine if the world could live without possessions, not as an explicit call to give them up. Blaney commented Lennon knew he had nothing concrete to offer, so instead he offers a dream, a concept to be built upon. In December, Lennon and Ono appeared at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Lennon performed Imagine with an acoustic guitar, yielding the earliest known live recording of the song, later included on the John Lennon Anthology. In, he sang Imagine during his final public performance, a birthday celebration for Lew Grade. The song was performed as part of the closing ceremony of the Summer Olympics. Performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Choir and the Liverpool Signing Choir, the choirs sang the first verse and accompanied Lennon s original vocals during the rest of the song. A cover performed by Emeli Sand was also used by the BBC for a closing montage that ended its coverage. Imagine subsequently re entered the UK Top, reaching number. In, American singer songwriter Lady Gaga performed the song at the European Games opening ceremony. The song was played for, people in Baku, Azerbaijan that served as host of the event. John Lennon vocals, piano Alan White drums The Jackson would release a second single with Steeltown Records before moving to Motown Records. The group s recordings at Steeltown Records were thought to be lost, but they were rediscovered more than years later. They were remastered and released in, with Big Boy as the promotional lead single. The Jackson Five would release a second and final single through Steeltown Records We Don t Have To Be Over to Fall in Love. The two singles were to be supported by an eleven track studio album but it was never released. On July, the group signed a contract with Motown Records. However, as the group s Steeltown contract had not yet expired, the new contract could not be fully executed until March,. Motown Records tried to get the group out of their Steeltown contract, and ultimately succeeded with a financial settlement. It is estimated that to million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of. In, Chagas was estimated to result in, deaths per year. Most people with the disease are poor, and most people with the disease do not realize they are infected. Large scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen an increase in the years up to. The disease was first described in by Carlos Chagas after whom it is named. It affects more than other animals. The human disease occurs in two stages an acute stage, which occurs shortly after an initial infection, and a chronic stage that develops over many years. In Argentina, the disease is known as mal de Chagas Mazza, in honor of Salvador Mazza, the Argentine physician who in began investigating the disease and over the years became the principal researcher of this disease in the country. Mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of Trypanosoma cruzi in Argentina in, eventually leading to support from local and European medical schools and Argentine government policy makers. Calvert had a total of thirteen children Cecil, who succeeded his father as the nd Baron Baltimore, Leonard, Anne, Mary, Dorothy, Elizabeth, Grace, Francis, George, Helen, Henry, John, and Philip. No disgrace was attached to Calvert s departure from office the King, to whom he had always remained personally loyal, confirmed his place on the Privy Council and appointed him Baron Baltimore, in County Longford in Leinster of central Ireland. Immediately after Calvert resigned, he converted to Roman Catholicism. The settlement appeared to be progressing so well that in January, Calvert obtained a concession from King James for the whole of Newfoundland, though the grant was soon reduced to cover only the southeastern Avalon peninsula, owing to competing claims from other English colonists. The final Charter constituted the province as a county palatinate, officially titled the Province of Avalon, under Calvert s personal rule. In, he sailed again for Newfoundland, this time with his second wife Jane, most of his children, and more settlers, to officially take over as Proprietary Governor of Avalon. He and his family moved into the house at Ferryland built by Wynne, a sizeable structure for the time, by colonial standards, and the only one in the settlement large enough to accommodate religious services for the community. Baltimore sent his children home to England in August. By the time the king s letter reached Avalon, he had departed with his wife and servants for Virginia. His health declining, Baltimore s persistence over the charter finally paid off in. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of Carolina into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries to the north of the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay. The charter was about to pass when the fifty two year old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln s Inn Fields, on April. Five weeks later, on June, the charter for Maryland passed the seals. years after its first settlement, Maryland joined twelve other British colonies along the Atlantic coast in declaring their independence from British rule and the right to freedom of religion for all citizens in the new United States. A pattern of political and financial motivation, and a lack of understanding of the geography and ecology of the Everglades have plagued the history of drainage projects. The Everglades are a part of a massive watershed that originates near Orlando and drains into Lake Okeechobee, a vast and shallow lake. As the lake exceeds its capacity in the wet season, the water forms a flat and very wide river, about miles km long and miles km wide. As the land from Lake Okeechobee slopes gradually to Florida Bay, water flows at a rate of half a mile. km a day. Before human activity in the Everglades, the system comprised the lower third of the Florida peninsula. The first attempt to drain the region was made by real estate developer Hamilton Disston in. Disston s sponsored canals were unsuccessful, but the land he purchased for them stimulated economic and population growth that attracted railway developer Henry Flagler. Flagler built a railroad along the east coast of Florida and eventually to Key West towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line. During his campaign to be elected governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised to drain the Everglades, and his later projects were more effective than Disston s. Broward s promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer s report, pressure from real estate developers, and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds hunted for their plumes, alligators, and other Everglades animals. Severe hurricanes in and caused catastrophic damage and flooding from Lake Okeechobee that prompted the Army Corps of Engineers to build a dike around the lake. Further floods in prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern Florida. Following another population boom after World War II, and the creation of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late s, following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to Everglades National Park, national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the Everglades. As early as, a visitor to the Everglades suggested the value of the land without the water Nevertheless, Smith returned a report to the Secretary of the Treasury asking for, to do the job. The report is the first published study on the topic of the Everglades, and concluded with the statement Smith suggested cutting through the rim of the Everglades known today as the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, connecting the heads of rivers to the coastline so that feet. m of water would be drained from the area. The result, Smith hoped, would yield farmland suitable for corn, sugar, rice, cotton, and tobacco. Disston s engineers focused on Lake Okeechobee as well. As one colleague put it, Okeechobee is the point to attack the canals were to be equal or greater than the inflow from the Kissimmee valley, which is the source of all the evil. Disston sponsored the digging of a canal miles km long from Lake Okeechobee towards Miami, but it was abandoned when the rock proved denser than the engineers had expected. Though the canals lowered the groundwater, their capacity was inadequate for the wet season. A report that evaluated the failure of the project concluded The reduction of the waters is simply a question of sufficient capacity in the canals which may be dug for their relief. The focus of government agencies quickly shifted to the control of floods rather than drainage. The Okeechobee Flood Control District, financed by both state and federal funds, was created in. President Herbert Hoover toured the towns affected by the Okeechobee Hurricane and, an engineer himself, ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to assist the communities surrounding the lake. Between and, a dike miles km long was built around the southern edge of the lake, and a shorter one around the northern edge. It was feet m tall and. feet. m thick on the lake side, feet. m thick on the top, and feet. m thick toward land. Control of the Hoover Dike and the waters of Lake Okeechobee were delegated to federal powers the United States declared legal limits of the lake to be feet. m and feet. m. DuMont Laboratories was founded in by Dr. Allen B. DuMont with only, and a laboratory in his basement. He and his staff were responsible for many early technical innovations, including the first consumer all electronic television set in. The company s television sets soon became the gold standard of the industry. In, DuMont worked with the Army in developing radar technology during World War II. This ended up bringing in million in capital for the company. Ted Mack s The Original Amateur Hour, which began on radio in the s under original host Edward Bowes The Morey Amsterdam Show, a comedy variety show hosted by Morey Amsterdam, which started on CBS before moving to DuMont in Captain Video and His Video Rangers, a hugely popular kids science fiction series The Arthur Murray Party, a dance program Down You Go, a popular panel show Live coverage of boxing and professional wrestling, the latter featuring matches staged by the Capitol Wrestling Corporation, the predecessor to WWE The Johns Hopkins Science Review, a Peabody Award winning education program Cash and Carry, the first network televised game show The Ernie Kovacs Show, the first truly innovative show in what was then visual radio, not television. Although DuMont s programming pre dated videotape, many DuMont offerings were recorded on kinescopes. These kinescopes were said to be stored in a warehouse until the s. Actress Edie Adams, the wife of comedian Ernie Kovacs both regular performers on early television testified in before a panel of the Library of Congress on the preservation of television and video. Adams claimed that so little value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were loaded into three trucks and dumped into Upper New York Bay. Nevertheless, a number of DuMont programs survive at The Paley Center for Media in New York City, the UCLA Film and Television Archive in Los Angeles, in the Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia, and the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago. DuMont programs were by necessity low budget affairs, and the network received relatively few awards from the TV industry. Most awards during the s went to NBC and CBS, who were able to out spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the relatively new television medium. DuMont, however, did win a number of awards during its years of operation. The Johns Hopkins Science Review, a DuMont public affairs program, was awarded a Peabody Award in in the Education category. Sheen s Emmy and the Science Review Peabody were the only national awards the DuMont Network received. Though DuMont series and performers continued to win local TV awards, by the mid s the DuMont network no longer had a national presence. The earliest measurements of TV audiences were performed by the C. E. Hooper company of New York. DuMont performed well in the Hooper ratings in fact, DuMont s talent program, The Original Amateur Hour, was the most popular series of the season. Variety ranked DuMont s popular variety series Cavalcade of Stars as the tenth most popular series two seasons later. By this time, DuMont had begun to differentiate itself from NBC and CBS. It allowed its advertisers to choose the locations where their advertising ran, potentially saving them millions of dollars. By contrast, ABC operated like CBS and NBC even though it was only a fourth as large, forcing advertisers to purchase a large must buy list of stations. ABC s fortunes were dramatically altered in February, when the FCC cleared the way for UPT to buy the network. The merger provided ABC with a badly needed cash infusion, giving it the resources to mount top shelf programming and to provide a national television service on a scale approaching that of CBS and NBC. Through UPT president Leonard Goldenson, ABC also gained ties with the Hollywood studios that more than matched those DuMont s producers had with Broadway. For years, DuMont was the only major broadcast television network to cease operations, until CBS Corporation and Time Warner shut down two other struggling networks, UPN and The WB, in September to create The CW Television Network whose schedule was originally composed largely of programs from both of its predecessor networks. At its peak in, DuMont was affiliated with around television stations. In those days, television stations were free to cherry pick which programs they would air, and many stations affiliated with multiple networks, depending mainly on the number of commercial television stations available in a market at a given time markets where only one commercial station was available carried programming from all four major networks. Many of DuMont s affiliates carried very little DuMont programming, choosing to air one or two more popular programs such as Life Is Worth Living and or sports programming on the weekends. Few stations carried the full DuMont program lineup. In its later years, DuMont was carried mostly on poorly watched UHF channels or had only secondary affiliations on VHF stations. DuMont ended most operations on April, but honored network commitments until August. Once the team arrived in Australia, Jardine quickly alienated the press by refusing to give team details before a match and being uncooperative during interviews. The press printed some negative stories as a result and the crowds barracked as they had done on his previous tour, which angered him. During the season, Woodfull s physical courage, stoic and dignified leadership won him many admirers. He flatly refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did not publicly complain even though he and his men were repeatedly hit. There is no way I will be influenced to adopt such tactics which bring such discredit to the game. I know Tim could do it but I am not going to participate in actions that can only hurt the game. I don t want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there, one is playing cricket. The other is making no attempt to do so. The next day, Larwood fractured wicket keeper Bert Oldfield s skull. This occurred when Oldfield mis hit a hook, which flew from the top edge off a traditional non bodyline ball Oldfield later admitted it was his fault. As a result of the injuries, the costs of insurance cover for players doubled. At the end of the fourth day s play the Australian Board of Control for Cricket sent the following cable to the MCC in London As a direct consequence of the tour, the MCC introduced a new rule to the laws of cricket for the English cricket season. Originally, the MCC hoped that captains would ensure that the game was played in the correct spirit, and passed a resolution that bodyline bowling would breach this spirit. When this proved to be insufficient, the MCC passed a law that direct attack bowling was unfair and became the responsibility of the umpires to identify and stop. In, the laws were altered to prevent more than two fielders standing behind square on the leg side the intention was to prevent negative bowling tactics whereby off spinners and slow inswing bowlers aimed at the leg stump of batsmen with fielders concentrated on the leg side. However, an indirect effect was to make bodyline fields impossible to implement. To this day, the bodyline tour remains one of the most significant events in the history of cricket, and strong in the consciousness of many cricket followers. In a poll of cricket journalists, commentators, and players in, the bodyline tour was ranked the most important event in cricket history. Over the years Waterfall Gully has been extensively logged, and early agricultural interests saw the cultivation of a variety of introduced species as crops, along with the development of local market gardens and nurseries. Attempts to mine the area were largely unsuccessful, but the region housed one of the state s earliest water powered mills, and a weir erected in the early s provided for part of the City of Burnside s water supply. Today the suburb consists primarily of private residences and parks. While the route to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was on public land, the alternative route along the gully was through private properties. Nevertheless, many visitors chose this route, and a combination of public demand and a desire from some of the landowners for improved access to and from their properties especially from the Mgge family led to pressure to build a road through the gully. Although there was opposition from some of the locals, the Waterfall Gully road was built in the late s. The land remained under the Burnside Council s control until, when the Waterfall Gully Reserve was reclaimed by the government as the first National Pleasure Resort in the state. Initially the reserve was placed under the jurisdiction of the National Parks Advisory Board, but later it was moved to the Tourist Bureau, before finally becoming part of the National Park Commission s portfolio. The census area that incorporates Waterfall Gully has a larger proportion of those in both the younger and older age ranges than in the City of Burnside as a whole, and there have been no numerically significant changes in the age distribution between the and censuses. Similarly, family numbers are also stable, with almost no change between and. During a visit to the Pyrenees during the summer of, Tennyson sought to give aid to Spanish rebels. During that time, he was affected by his experience and the influence appears in Mariana in the South, which was published in it is a later version that follows the idea of The Lady of Shalott. Within the poem, Tennyson does not teach the audience what melancholy means. Instead, he describes its various aspects as he begins That held the pear to the gable wall. The broken sheds looked sad and strange She only said, My life is dreary, She said, I am aweary, aweary I would that I were dead, lines She could not look on the sweet heaven, About a stone cast from the wall Mariana is trapped by her surroundings, and the last stanza begins with her becoming sensitive to sound as she starts to mentally lose her place in reality The slow clock ticking, and the sound Which to the wooing wind aloof Her sense lines The poem ends with a description that even the sunlight is unable to do anything more than reveal dust in her home The poem ends with an altered version of the refrain, which serves to show that although she wishes her death she is still alive and, in the final moment, allows her to end the poem instead of allowing the poem to end her Then, said she, I am very dreary, He will not come, she said O God, that I were dead, lines In December, Bono stated that he had a love hate relationship with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, There s no question in my mind of the Reagan Administration s involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It s not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make. In, Clayton noted We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America. He said Mothers of the Disappeared was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government, and described Bono s vocals as prehistoric, saying it connects with something very primitive. U debuted Mothers of the Disappeared on April in San Diego, California, on the first leg of the Joshua Tree Tour, where it closed the concert in place of the band s long time finale. It was performed three more times on the leg twice to open the encore and once to conclude the main set. U revived the song seven months later on the third leg, playing it in the encore at three of the final four concerts on the tour. The cost of the tickets was too high for many fans in South America, so the band broadcast the February concert in Chile live on television. Knowing that many people in the country would be watching, they played Mothers of the Disappeared in place of Wake Up Dead Man. The stadium in which the concert was held had been used as a prison camp by Pinochet s regime following the coup d tat. Again it was performed solely by Bono and the Edge against footage of the Madres, and they invited the women to join them on stage a second time. The Madres held up photographs of their children and spoke about them briefly during the performance, an act which received a mixed reception from the audience. Bono made a plea to Pinochet, asking him to tell these women where are the bones of their children. Mothers of the Disappeared has been covered several times. The Vitamin String Quartet included it on their tribute album The String Quartet Tribute to U s The Joshua Tree. Paddy Casey recorded a version for the tsunami relief album Even Better Than the Real Thing Vol. in. Commander Katherine Pulaski is a fictional medical doctor in the American science fiction television series Star Trek The Next Generation. She is the chief medical officer aboard the Federation starship USS Enterprise D. Her medical skills saved the lives of Captain Jean Luc Picard and Commander William Riker, and she helped inspire Lt. Commander Data to create a hologram of Professor Moriarty that became self aware. Pulaski preferred to avoid the transporter, but was forced to rely on it to save her own life from an alien infection. Before arriving on the Enterprise D, she previously served on the USS Repulse. For a time, she was romantically involved with Kyle Riker, but they continued to remain friends. Towards the end of the first season of Star Trek The Next Generation, staff members convinced Gene Roddenberry to drop Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher from the show. Executive producer Rick Berman opposed this decision. To allow for McFadden s return in the future, Roddenberry wrote Crusher s character out rather than killing her. McFadden s departure led to an opening for a new cast member. The producers contacted American actress Diana Muldaur, unaware of her past involvement with Roddenberry s Star Trek and Planet Earth pilot. In The Original Series, Muldaur played the role of a doctor in two episodes as Dr. Ann Mulhall in Return to Tomorrow, and as Dr. Miranda Jones in Is There in Truth No Beauty, Muldaur also worked on the pilot for Planet Earth after getting to know Roddenberry and his wife, Majel Barrett, through their annual Star Trek Christmas parties. The noisy miner is similar in appearance to the yellow throated miner and the black eared miner it has a dull white forehead and a black crown, while the others have grey heads. The noisy miner also produces non vocal sounds by clicking or snapping its bill, usually during antagonistic encounters with other bird species, or when mobbing a predator. In the first study to demonstrate different learning techniques in a single species, the noisy miner was found to employ different cognitive strategies depending upon the resource it was foraging. When searching for nectar, which does not move but is readily depleted, the noisy miner uses a spatial memory based strategy, identifying characteristics of the environment a strategy that is efficient in new environments and is not affected by changes in the bird s activities. When searching for invertebrates, it appears to employ a different strategy based on learned rules of insect movement they improve at finding invertebrates with practice. The two different strategies imply the existence of adapted cognitive mechanisms, capable of responding appropriately to different foraging contexts. Cooperative breeding has been described as a strategy for decreasing nest predation, although one study found no relationship between the number of helpers visiting a nest site and its success or failure. Noisy miners were seen to have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success including multiple broods, laying eggs early in the season, nesting low in the canopy and group mobbing of predators these measures did not guarantee against nest failure due to the diversity of potential predators in the noisy miner s open woodland habitat. The Principe Amedeo class was a pair of ironclad warships built for the Italian Regia Marina Royal Navy in the s and s. They were the culmination of a major naval construction program designed to give Italy a powerful fleet of ironclads. The two ships, Principe Amedeo and Palestro, were the last Italian ironclads to feature sailing rigs and wooden hulls. They were armed with a battery of six inch mm guns and were capable of a speed in excess of knots km h mph. The ships had uneventful careers, spending much of it in Italy s colonial empire. By the late s, they were withdrawn from service and employed in secondary roles, first as headquarters ships for harbor defenses. Principe Amedeo was converted into a depot ship in and was discarded in, while Palestro was used as a training ship from to before being scrapped in. The two ships were protected by iron belt armor that was. in mm thick and extended for the entire length of the hull. The casemates were protected with. in mm of iron plating, and the small conning tower had. in mm thick iron plates. The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes. The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle. The nucleus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane, it contains the majority of the cell s genetic material. This material is organized as DNA molecules, along with a variety of proteins, to form chromosomes. Gene expression first involves transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA mRNA, which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported. Most eukaryotic cell types usually have a single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division. As the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.

Credits lifted from the album liner notes Credits lifted from the album liner notes Ceres was the first asteroid discovered, by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo on January. It was originally considered a planet, but was reclassified as an asteroid in the s when many other objects in similar orbits were discovered. Ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle, and may have a remnant internal ocean of liquid water under the layer of ice. The surface is probably a mixture of water ice and various hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay. In January, emissions of water vapor were detected from several regions of Ceres. This was unexpected, because large bodies in the asteroid belt do not typically emit vapor, a hallmark of comets., implying that recent geologic activity was probably involved in the creation of the bright spots. In October, NASA released a true color portrait of Ceres made by Dawn. As other objects were discovered in the neighborhood of Ceres, it was realized that Ceres represented the first of a new class of objects. In, with the discovery of Pallas, William Herschel coined the term asteroid star like for these bodies, writing that they resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them, even by very good telescopes. As the first such body to be discovered, Ceres was given the designation Ceres under the modern system of minor planet designations. By the s, the existence of a fundamental difference between asteroids such as Ceres and the major planets was widely accepted, though a precise definition of planet was never formulated. Ceres follows an orbit between Mars and Jupiter, within the asteroid belt, with a period of. Earth years. The orbit is moderately inclined i. compared to. for Mars. The rotation period of Ceres the Cererian day is hours and minutes. It has a small axial tilt of. This is nevertheless large enough for Ceres s polar regions to contain permanently shadowed craters that are expected to act as cold traps and accumulate water ice over time, similar to the situation on the Moon and Mercury. About. of water molecules released from the surface are expected to end up in the traps, hopping an average of times before escaping or being trapped. Ceres surface is relatively warm. The maximum temperature with the Sun overhead was estimated from measurements to be K approximately C, F on May. Ice is unstable at this temperature. Material left behind by the sublimation of surface ice could explain the dark surface of Ceres compared to the icy moons of the outer Solar System. There are indications that Ceres may have a tenuous water vapor atmosphere outgassing from water ice on the surface. Some notable observations and milestones for Ceres include and Visible light images with km resolution the best prior to the Dawn mission taken using Hubble. Ceres was found to have an atmosphere with water vapor, confirmed by the Herschel space telescope. The NASA Dawn spacecraft approached and orbited Ceres, sending detailed images and scientific data back to Earth. In the early s, NASA initiated the Discovery Program, which was intended to be a series of low cost scientific missions. In, the program s study team recommended as a high priority a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review. It was launched on September, as the space mission to make the first visits to both Vesta and Ceres. On May, Dawn acquired its first targeting image. million kilometers from Vesta. After orbiting Vesta for months, Dawn used its ion engine to depart for Ceres, with gravitational capture occurring on March at a separation of, km, four months prior to the New Horizons flyby of Pluto. Dawn s arrival in a stable orbit around Ceres was delayed after, close to reaching Ceres, it was hit by a cosmic ray, making it take another, longer route around Ceres in back, instead of a direct spiral towards it. Eilean a Che, which means island of the mist a translation of the Norse name, is a poetic Gaelic name for the island. Of the island in general, Johnson observed The island wide population increase of per cent between and occurred against the background of an overall reduction in Scottish island populations of per cent for the same period. By the population had risen a further. to, with Scottish island populations as a whole growing by to,. The unemployment rate in the area tends to be higher than in the Highlands as a whole, and is seasonal in nature, in part due to the impact of tourism. The population is growing and in common with many other scenic rural areas in Scotland, significant increases are expected in the percentage of the population aged to years. The Hebrides generally lack the biodiversity of mainland Britain, but like most of the larger islands, Skye still has a wide variety of species. Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that In recent years, FAU has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standings while also evolving into a more traditional university. The university has raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions. Changes include an on campus stadium, additional on campus housing, and the establishment of a College of Medicine in. On July, to meet the burgeoning educational demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on Boca Raton Army Airfield, a s era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the Army Air Corps sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing Boca Raton Airport and on, acres. km of adjacent land. A majority of the land was acquired from Japanese American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony. The land was seized through eminent domain, leaving many Japanese Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II. The airbase was used for radar training, anti submarine patrols along the coast, and as a stop over point for planes being ferried to Africa and Europe via South America. The airfield was composed of four runways, still visible on the Boca Campus today and mainly used for parking. Florida Atlantic s history is one of continuing expansion as the university s service population has grown. The university originally served only upper division and graduate level students, because Florida intended the institution to complement the state s community college system, accepting students who had earned their associate degrees from those institutions. In, the Florida Legislature recognized demands for higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university would establish a campus in Dania Beach in and another campus in the City of Davie in western Broward County in. Florida Atlantic later purchased acres ha of land in Port St. Lucie in to establish a campus on the Treasure Coast. This would be the institution s fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in when it opened its Jupiter Campus, named for the late John D. MacArthur. This campus houses the university s honors college. Florida Atlantic has changed dramatically since its opening in. As of, there are more than, students attending classes on seven campuses spread across miles km. The university consists of ten colleges and employs more than, faculty and staff. The university s endowment decreased from million in June to million in January due to a worsening economy. However, with the national economic recovery the endowment has increased to million by the end of. The average class size at FAU for undergraduates is students, and for graduate classes, students. The student to faculty ratio is. The top three undergraduate majors by enrollment are elementary education, accounting, and management, respectively. The top three graduate majors by enrollment are business administration, educational leadership, and accounting, respectively. The average age for first year students is however, the average age for all undergraduates is and the average age for graduate students is. The average year graduation rate for first time, non transfer students is while the year graduation rate is. Florida Atlantic University is a distributed university located on seven campuses spread across Palm Beach, Broward, and St. Lucie counties. The region is home to more than three million people. The university s main campus is located in the City of Boca Raton in Palm Beach County. The county is also home to the John D. MacArthur Campus located in the City of Jupiter. In addition to its campuses in Palm Beach County, the university operates three campuses in the Broward County cities of Dania Beach, Davie, and Fort Lauderdale. Florida Atlantic University also operates two campuses in the St. Lucie County cities of Port St. Lucie and Fort Pierce. In addition to students who attend classes on the universities campuses, there are, distance learning students who conduct their studies over the internet or through other means. These students account for of the university s student body. In addition to the Treasure Coast Campus, Florida Atlantic University operates a campus in Fort Pierce at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution. Harbor Branch merged with the university in to become the HBOI at FAU. The Florida Legislature allocated million for the university to acquire the institution and its acre. km campus. In, the Florida Atlantic football team finished six wins and six losses in regular season play and was invited to the Motor City Bowl. The Owls defeated Central Michigan University, increasing their bowl record to two wins and zero losses. During the previous season, the football team beat Troy University in the final game of regular season play to become Sun Belt Co Champions and receive an invitation to the New Orleans Bowl. In just the seventh year of the football program s history, and the third year playing in Division I, Florida Atlantic set NCAA records by both becoming the youngest program ever to receive an invitation to, and win, a bowl game. As a result of the New Orleans Bowl the university has seen a surge in school spirit. In past seasons the Owls have garnered a number of accolades for their accomplishments. During the season, the men s basketball team was noted as one of the Sun Belt Conference s top offensive teams, with a scary offense that earned it the reputation of the best shooting team in the conference. In, the men s basketball team defeated its first ever Southeastern Conference opponent Mississippi State University as well as Big East opponent the University of South Florida en route to a overall record and claimed the Sun Belt Conference title. Florida Atlantic University is home to a number of sports related traditions and school spirit organizations. Residential housing at Florida Atlantic University is available on the Boca Raton and John D. MacArthur campuses. All full time freshmen are required to reside in university housing, however, exemptions from this policy are made for students who are or older by the first day of class, reside with parent s or legal guardian s within a mile km radius of the Boca Raton campus, or are married. As of, students live on campus in Boca Raton. The Wilkes Honors College on the MacArthur Campus requires all students live on campus within its two residence halls, however, exceptions are made for students who are years of age, married, or have dependent children. As of, there are students residing on campus at the honors college. The book has been reviewed in USA Today, Business Week, Energy Priorities, Sustainability Investment News and several other magazines, and has been translated into seven languages. Clean Tech Nation is the sequel to The Clean Tech Revolution. The authors present a list of drivers for clean tech high energy prices, depleted natural resources, volatile sources of foreign oil, record deficits, and unprecedented environmental and security challenges. The central message, which is repeated in almost every chapter, is that a clean tech revolution with benefit humanity worldwide, and will require significant collaboration between the public and private sectors. The authors say that nuclear power and clean coal are not clean technologies. Apart from the risks associated with nuclear power, multibillion dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost effective when compared with other energy sources. The authors also believe that clean coal is an oxymoron for a myriad of reasons, including the sheer number of coal mine related deaths and the fact that coal fired plants, even some cleaner ones, are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma, heart disease, and mercury poisoning. Pernick and Wilder identify six major forces, which they call the six C s, that are pushing clean technology into the mainstream and driving rapid growth and expansion costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate. Capital. An unprecedented influx of capital is changing the clean tech landscape, with billions of dollars, euros, yen, and yuan pouring in from a myriad of public and private sector sources. Climate. The debate around climate change has gone from question mark to peer reviewed certainty, and smart businesses are taking heed. The Clean Tech Revolution was followed by the book Clean Tech Nation How the U.S. Can Lead in the New Global Economy. The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for, miles, km before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi arid watershed of more than half a million square miles, km, which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world s fourth longest river system. For over, years, people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation. More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed, most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous buffalo herds that once roamed through the Great Plains. The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century, and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before finally becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. The Missouri was long believed to be part of the Northwest Passage a water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific but when Lewis and Clark became the first to travel the river s entire length, they confirmed the mythical pathway to be no more than a legend. The Missouri s drainage basin has highly variable weather and rainfall patterns, Overall, the watershed is defined by a Continental climate with warm, wet summers and harsh, cold winters. Most of the watershed receives an average of to inches to mm of precipitation each year. However, the westernmost portions of the basin in the Rockies as well as southeastern regions in Missouri may receive as much as inches, mm. The vast majority of precipitation occurs in winter, although the upper basin is known for short lived but intense summer thunderstorms such as the one which produced the Black Hills flood through Rapid City, South Dakota. Winter temperatures in Montana, Wyoming and Colorado may drop as low as F C, while summer highs in Kansas and Missouri have reached F C at times. Over significant tributaries and hundreds of smaller ones feed the Missouri River, with most of the larger ones coming in as the river draws close to the mouth. Most rivers and streams in the Missouri River basin flow from west to east, following the incline of the Great Plains however, some eastern tributaries such as the James, Big Sioux and Grand River systems flow from north to south. See also List of locks and dams of the Upper Mississippi River, List of locks and dams of the Ohio River Meriwether Lewis and William Clark began their famed expedition in with a party of thirty three people in three boats. Although they became the first Europeans to travel the entire length of the Missouri and reach the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia, they found no trace of the Northwest Passage. The maps made by Lewis and Clark, especially those of the Pacific Northwest region, provided a foundation for future explorers and emigrants. They also negotiated relations with multiple Native American tribes and wrote extensive reports on the climate, ecology and geology of the region. Many present day names of geographic features in the upper Missouri basin originated from their expedition. The first glowing reports of country rich with thousands of game animals came in when Meriwether Lewis and William Clark returned from their two year expedition. Their journals described lands rich with thousands of buffalo, beaver, and river otter and also an abundant population of sea otters on the Pacific Northwest coast. In, explorer Manuel Lisa organized an expedition which would lead to the explosive growth of the fur trade in the upper Missouri River country. Lisa and his crew traveled up the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers, trading manufactured items in return for furs from local Native American tribes, and established a fort at the confluence of the Yellowstone and a tributary, the Bighorn, in southern Montana. Although the business started small, it quickly grew into a thriving trade. As settlers expanded their holdings into the Great Plains, they ran into land conflicts with Native American tribes. This resulted in frequent raids, massacres and armed conflicts, leading to the federal government creating multiple treaties with the Plains tribes, which generally involved establishing borders and reserving lands for the indigenous. As with many other treaties between the U.S. and Native Americans, they were soon broken, leading to huge wars. Over, battles, big and small, were fought between the U.S. military and Native Americans before the tribes were forced out of their land onto reservations. In the late th and early th centuries, a great number of dams were built along the course of the Missouri, transforming percent of the river into a chain of reservoirs. River development was stimulated by a variety of factors, first by growing demand for electricity in the rural northwestern parts of the basin, and also by floods and droughts that plagued rapidly growing agricultural and urban areas along the lower Missouri River. Small, privately owned hydroelectric projects have existed since the s, but the large flood control and storage dams that characterize the middle reaches of the river today were not constructed until the s. The Missouri basin suffered a series of catastrophic floods around the turn of the th century, most notably in, and. In, as part of the Great Depression era New Deal, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers USACE completed Fort Peck Dam in Montana. Construction of this massive public works project provided jobs for more than, laborers during the Depression and was a major step in providing flood control to the lower half of the Missouri River. However, Fort Peck only controls runoff from percent of the Missouri River watershed, and had little effect on a severe snowmelt flood that struck the lower basin three years later. This event was particularly destructive as it submerged manufacturing plants in Omaha and Kansas City, greatly delaying shipments of military supplies in World War II. Flooding damages on the Mississippi Missouri river system were one of the primary reasons for which Congress passed the Flood Control Act of, opening the way for the USACE to develop the Missouri on a massive scale. The act authorized the Pick Sloan Missouri Basin Program Pick Sloan Plan, which was a composite of two widely varying proposals. The Pick plan, with an emphasis on flood control and hydroelectric power, called for the construction of large storage dams along the main stem of the Missouri. The Sloan plan, which stressed the development of local irrigation, included provisions for roughly smaller dams on tributaries. By tonnage of transported material, Missouri is by far the largest user of the river accounting for percent of river traffic, while Kansas has percent, Nebraska three percent and Iowa two percent. Almost all of the barge traffic on the Missouri River ships sand and gravel dredged from the lower miles km of the river the remaining portion of the shipping channel now sees little to no use by commercial vessels. Restoration projects have re mobilized some of the sediments that had been trapped behind bank stabilization structures, prompting concerns of exacerbated nutrient and sediment pollution locally and downstream in the northern Gulf of Mexico. A National Research Council report assessed the roles of sediment in the Missouri River, evaluating current habitat restoration strategies and alternative ways to manage sediment. The report found that a better understanding of sediment processes in the Missouri River, including the creation of a sediment budget an accounting of sediment transport, erosion, and deposition volumes for the length of the Missouri River would provide a foundation for projects to improve water quality standards and protect endangered species. In north central Montana, some, acres, km along over miles km of the Missouri River, centering on Fort Peck Lake, comprise the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. The wildlife refuge consists of a native northern Great Plains ecosystem that has not been heavily affected by human development, except for the construction of Fort Peck Dam. Although there are few designated trails, the whole preserve is open to hiking and camping. In its original broadcast, Monty Can t Buy Me Love was seen by approximately. million viewers, and finished in rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following the release of The Simpsons The Complete Tenth Season, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. The assault troops, mostly from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ANZAC, landed at night on the western Aegean Sea side of the peninsula. They were put ashore one mile. km north of their intended landing beach. In the darkness, the assault formations became mixed up, but the troops gradually made their way inland, under increasing opposition from the Ottoman Turkish defenders. Not long after coming ashore the ANZAC plans were discarded, and the companies and battalions were thrown into battle piece meal, and received mixed orders. Some advanced to their designated objectives while others were diverted to other areas, then ordered to dig in along defensive ridge lines. Since the anniversary of the landings on April has been commemorated as Anzac Day, becoming one of the most important national celebrations in Australia and New Zealand. The anniversary is also commemorated in Turkey, the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Ottoman Turkish Empire entered the First World War on the side of the Central Powers on October. The stalemate of trench warfare on the Western Front convinced the British Imperial War Cabinet that an attack on the Central Powers elsewhere, particularly Turkey, could be the best way of winning the war. From February this took the form of naval operations aimed at forcing a passage through the Dardanelles, but after several setbacks it was decided that a land campaign was also necessary. To that end, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was formed under the command of General Ian Hamilton. Three amphibious landings were planned to secure the Gallipoli Peninsula, which would allow the navy to attack the Turkish capital Constantinople, in the hope that would convince the Turks to ask for an armistice. The location chosen for the operation was between the headland of Gaba Tepe and the Fisherman s Hut, three miles. km to the north. Landing at dawn after a naval gunfire bombardment, the first troops were to seize the lower crests and southern spurs of Hill. The second wave would pass them to capture the spur of Hill, especially Mal Tepe. There they would be positioned to cut the enemy s lines of communications to the Kilid Bahr Plateau, thus preventing the Turks from bringing reinforcements from the north to the Kilid Bahr Plateau during the attack by the British th Division which would advance from a separate beachhead further south west. The capture of Mal Tepe was more vital and valuable than the capture of the Kilid Bahr Plateau itself. Birdwood planned to arrive off the peninsula after the moon had set, with the first troops landing at, an hour before dawn. He declined the offer of an old merchant ship, loaded with troops, being deliberately grounded at Gaba Tepe. Instead, the troops were to travel in naval and merchant ships, transferring to rowing boats towed by small steamboats to make the assault. Men from the th and th Battalions started up the Ari Burnu slope, grabbing the gorse branches or digging their bayonets into the soil to provide leverage. At the peak they found an abandoned trench, the Turks having withdrawn inland. Soon the Australians reached Plugge s Plateau, the edge of which was defended by a trench, but the Turks had withdrawn to the next summit two hundred yards m inland, from where they fired at the Australians coming onto the plateau. As they arrived, Major Edmund Brockman of the th Battalion started sorting out the mess, sending the th Battalion s men to the right flank, the th Battalion s to the left, and keeping the th Battalion in the centre. The second six companies landed while it was still dark, the destroyers coming to within five hundred yards m to disembark the troops, under fire. They also landed at Anzac Cove, but now as planned the th were in the north, th in the centre and the th in the south. The th Battalion landed all along the beach. This extended the beachhead yards m to the north of Ari Burnu, and. miles. km to the south. Landing under fire, some of the assaulting troops were killed in their boats, and others as they reached the beach. Once ashore they headed inland. In the south, the first men from the th and th Battalions reached the bottom of Plateau. Baby is a hill in the Sari Bair range, next to Battleship Hill or Big. It was named after its supposed height above sea level, though its actual height is only feet m. Maclagen sent the th Battalion, Captain Joseph Lalor s company of the th Battalion and Major James Robertson s of the th, towards Baby. Brockman divided his own company, sending half up the right fork of Rest Gully, and half up the left, while Brockman and a reserve platoon headed up Monash Valley. As they moved forward, Turkish artillery targeted them with air burst shrapnel shells, which dispersed the companies. This, coupled with senior officers diverting men to other areas instead of towards Baby, meant only fragments of the units eventually reached Baby. At Robertson and Lalor decided to take their companies up Baby. Instead of going round to the right like Tulloch, they went straight up the centre, crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground. A spur on their left, leading to Suvla Bay, was defended by a Turkish trench system. At Turkish troops started moving down Battleship Hill, and for the next hour they exchanged fire. Where the spur joined Baby, a group of Australians from the th, th, and th Battalions crossed Malone s Gully and charged the Turkish trench. A Turkish machine gun on Baby opened fire on them, forcing them back, followed by a general withdrawal of Australian troops. The Turks had secured Battleship Hill and were now driving the Australians off Baby. From his headquarters at the head of Monash Valley, Maclagen could see the Turks attacking, and started sending all available men towards Baby. The nd Brigade landed between and, and the reserve st Brigade landed between and, already putting the timetable behind schedule. The nd Brigade, which was supposed to be heading for Baby on the left, were instead sent to the right to counter a Turkish attack building up there. At Bridges and his staff landed finding no senior officers on the beach to brief them, they set out to locate the rd Brigade headquarters. The st Brigade was on the opposite flank to the rd Brigade and already getting involved in battles of its own, when its commander, Colonel Percy Owen, received a request from Maclagen for reinforcements. Owen sent two companies from the rd Battalion and one from the st Battalion Swannell s to support the rd Brigade. Soon after, Lalor s company had been forced back to The Nek and the Turks were threatening to recapture Russell s Top, and at Maclagen reported to Bridges his doubts over being able to hold out. In response Bridges sent part of his reserve, two companies from the nd Battalion Gordon s and Richardson s, to reinforce the rd Brigade. At Swannell s company arrived at the foot of Baby, joining the seventy survivors of Robertson s and Lalor s companies. They immediately charged and chased the Turks back over the summit of Baby, then stopped and dug in. The two nd Battalion companies arrived alongside them, but all the companies had taken casualties, among the dead being Swannell and Robertson. By this time most of the rd Brigade men had been killed or wounded, and the line was held by the five depleted companies from the st Brigade. On the left, Gordon s company nd Battalion, with the th and th Battalion s survivors, charged five times and captured the summit of Baby, but were driven back by Turkish counter attacks Gordon was among the casualties. For the second time Maclagen requested reinforcements for Baby, but the only reserves Bridges had available were two nd Battalion companies and the th Battalion. It was now and the advance companies of the st New Zealand Brigade were disembarking, so it was decided they would go to Baby. The New Zealand Brigade commander had been taken ill, so Birdwood appointed Brigadier General Harold Walker, a staff officer already ashore, as commander. The Auckland Battalion had landed by, and were being sent north along the beach to Walker s Ridge on their way to Russell s Top. Seeing that the only way along the ridge was in single file along a goat track, Walker ordered them to take the route over Plugge s Plateau. As each New Zealand unit landed they were directed the same way to Baby. However, in trying to avoid Turkish fire, they became split up in Monash Valley and Rest Gully, and it was after midday that two of the Auckland companies reached Baby. The Plateau, named for its height above sea level, was a wide and level plateau on the second ridge line, about six hundred by six hundred yards by m wide and around one thousand yards m from Gun Ridge. The northern half of the plateau became known as Johnston s Jolly, and the southern half as Lone Pine, with Owen s Gully between them. At McCay signalled Bridges that large numbers of unwounded men were leaving the battlefield and heading for the beaches. This was followed by Maclagan asking for urgent artillery fire support, onto Gun Ridge, as his left was under a heavy attack and at Owen reported the left flank was rapidly being forced to retire. At dusk Maclagan made his way to Bridges headquarters and when asked for his opinion replied It s touch and go. If the Turks come on in mass formation... I don t think anything can stop them. As it got dark the Turkish artillery ceased firing, and although small arms fire continued on both sides, the effects were limited when firing blind. Darkness also provided the opportunity to start digging more substantial trenches and to resupply the troops with water and ammunition. The last significant action of the day was at south of Lone Pine, when the Turks charged towards Bolton s Ridge. By now the th Battalion had positioned two machine guns to cover their front, which caused devastation amongst the attackers, and to their left the th Battalion also became involved. When the Turks got to within fifty yards m the th Battalion counter attacked in a bayonet charge and the Turks withdrew. The ANZAC defence was aided by Royal Navy searchlights providing illumination. Both sides now waited for the next attack, but the day s events had shattered both formations and they were no longer in any condition to conduct offensive operations. By nightfall, around sixteen thousand men had been landed, and the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, although with several undefended sections. It stretched along Bolton s Ridge in the south, across Plateau, to Monash Valley. After a short gap it resumed at Pope s Hill, then at the top of Walker s Ridge. It was not a large beachhead it was under two miles. km in length, with a depth around yards m, and in places only a few yards separated the two sides. That evening Birdwood had been ashore to check on the situation, and, satisfied, returned to HMS Queen. Around he was asked to return to the beachhead. There he met with his senior officers, who asked him to arrange an evacuation. Unwilling to make that decision on his own he signalled Hamilton In the following days there were several failed attacks and counter attacks by both sides. The Turks were the first to try during the Second attack on Anzac Cove on April, followed by the ANZACs who tried to advance overnight May. The Turkish Third attack on Anzac Cove on May was the worst defeat of them all, with around ten thousand casualties, including three thousand dead. The next four months consisted of only local or diversionary attacks, until August when the ANZACs, in connection with the Landing at Suvla Bay, attacked Chunuk Bair with only limited success. The Turks never succeeded in driving the Australians and New Zealanders back into the sea. Similarly, the ANZACs never broke out of their beachhead. Instead, in December, after eight months of fighting, they evacuated the peninsula. The episode received mostly positive reviews, which ranged from okay to fabulous, with approval being given to the resurrection of neglected storylines from the show s first season. One of these was the adoption of Beth, and critics were especially happy with the scene where Puck meets her, but there was widespread disdain for the explanation behind Shelby s return, that of starting a rival glee club. There were only three musical numbers in the episode, though all three were given positive notices, with the overall favorite being Blaine s performance of Something s Coming from West Side Story at the end of the episode. All three songs were released as singles, available for download, and Somewhere, sung as a duet by Menzel and Lea Michele, charted on the Billboard Hot. It did not chart on the Canadian Hot. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by. million American viewers and garnered a. Nielsen rating share in the demographic. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were down from the previous week s season opener, The Purple Piano Project. To avoid competing with Kurt, Blaine auditions for a supporting role with a rendition of Something s Coming, one of Tony s songs from the show. The directors are impressed, and ask if he will read for the part of Tony instead. Kurt, who was watching from above, silently walks out of the auditorium. Three singles were released from the episode I m the Greatest Star from Funny Girl sung by Colfer, and covers of Something s Coming and Somewhere from West Side Story the former sung by Criss, and the latter a duet between Michele and Menzel. In the United Kingdom, I Am Unicorn was watched on Sky by, viewers, down, from the season premiere the previous week. In Australia, the episode drew, viewers, which made Glee the fifteenth most watched program of the night, down from the season premiere s twelfth most watched program of the night and, viewers in the previous week. In Canada,. million viewers watched the episode, and it was the eighteenth most viewed show of the week, down eight slots and from the. million who watched The Purple Piano Project. One of the three cover versions released as singles debuted on the Billboard Hot, and none charted on the Canadian Hot or in England or Australia. The duet version of Somewhere appeared at number seventy five, the fourth time the song charted in the Hot. By contrast, Something s Coming, the episode s other song from West Side Story, has never appeared in the Hot, and failed to chart there again. According to Nielsen Media Research, Galentine s Day was seen by. million household viewers, which marked a continued recent improvement in ratings for the series. It tied a record set with the previous episode, Sweetums, for the season s highest rating among viewers aged between and. The episode received generally positive reviews. In its original American NBC broadcast on February, Galentine s Day was seen by. million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. This marked a continued recent improvement in ratings for the series. Galentine s Day was seen by more viewers than the previous week s episode Sweetums, which drew. million viewers and was an itself an increase from previous episodes. Galentine s Day drew an overall. rating share, and a. rating share among viewers between and, the latter of which tied with Sweetums as the highest of its age group for the series. The subsequent episode, Woman of the Year, would also tie the two episodes for a series high rating in that to age group. Galentine s Day, along with the other second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four disc DVD set in the United States on November,. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode. Digital download Bossy Although the annual distribution of food and drink is known to have taken place since at least, no records exist of the story of the sisters prior to. Records of that time say that the names of the sisters were not known, and early drawings of Biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters it is not until the early th century that the names Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst were first used. In, the Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, and the resulting income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably, providing the widows and pensioners of Biddenden with cheese, bread and tea at Easter and with cash payments at Christmas. Biddenden cakes continue to be given to the poor of Biddenden each Easter, and are sold as souvenirs to visitors. In the disorder and indecency of the annual dole led to the threat of intervention by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The distribution of the dole ceased to be conducted inside the church it was moved to the church porch. As the annual dole grew larger the Easter distribution became increasingly popular. In a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church at Easter, the first recorded mention of the names Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst, and clay replicas of Biddenden cakes were sold as souvenirs. In almost all drawings and Biddenden cake designs, the twins are shown as conjoined at both the hip and the shoulder. Although such a fusion is theoretically possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, no case of a viable double fusion has ever been documented. lfric died on November and was buried in Abingdon Abbey, later being translated to Canterbury Cathedral. His will survives and in it he left ships to the people of Wiltshire and Kent, with his best one, equipped for sixty men, going to King thelred. The hagiography of Dunstan was dedicated to lfric at the end of the th century. After his death, he was considered a saint with a feast day of November. French English, United States, New American Library, pages, paperback As a method of birth control, male condoms have the advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, having few side effects, and offering protection against sexually transmitted infections. With proper use and use at every act of intercourse women whose partners use male condoms experience a per year pregnancy rate. With typical use the rate of pregnancy is per year. Condoms have been used for at least years. Since the th century, they have been one of the most popular methods of contraception in the world. While widely accepted in modern times, condoms have generated some controversy, primarily over what role they should play in sex education classes. The typical use pregnancy rate among condom users varies depending on the population being studied, ranging from to per year. The perfect use pregnancy rate of condoms is per year. Condoms may be combined with other forms of contraception such as spermicide for greater protection. Condoms may slip off the penis after ejaculation, break due to improper application or physical damage such as tears caused when opening the package, or break or slip due to latex degradation typically from usage past the expiration date, improper storage, or exposure to oils. The rate of breakage is between. and., while the rate of slippage is between. and.. Even if no breakage or slippage is observed, of women will test positive for semen residue after intercourse with a condom. Different modes of condom failure result in different levels of semen exposure. If a failure occurs during application, the damaged condom may be disposed of and a new condom applied before intercourse begins such failures generally pose no risk to the user. One study found that semen exposure from a broken condom was about half that of unprotected intercourse semen exposure from a slipped condom was about one fifth that of unprotected intercourse. Among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom. The person may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to take a chance. This type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure as opposed to method or perfect use failure. The most common non latex condoms are made from polyurethane. Condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials, such as AT resin, and most recently polyisoprene. Polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms, with most polyurethane condoms between. mm and. mm thick. However, polyurethane condoms are less elastic than latex ones, and may be more likely to slip or break than latex, lose their shape or bunch up more than latex, and are more expensive. In March, the Swiss government announced that it was planning to promote smaller condoms intended for boys and youths of years old following concern about the pregnancy rate among adolescent girls, and also about the potential spread of AIDS among this age group. This was due to the fact that standard condoms were too wide and consequently failed to afford protection to adolescent boys during vaginal and anal intercourse. Family planning groups and the Swiss AIDS Federation had campaigned to have a narrower condom produced for youths after a number of studies, including a government study researched at the Centre for Development and Personality Psychology at Basel University, found that standard condoms were unsuitable for boys in this age range, and that the condoms either failed during use or that the boys rejected them altogether because they were too wide, and consequently they used no protection at all. The anti rape condom is another variation designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape. Some condom like devices are intended for entertainment only, such as glow in the dark condoms. These novelty condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and STDs. The prevalence of condom use varies greatly between countries. Most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women, or women in informal unions. Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world in that country, condoms account for almost of contraceptive use by married women. On average, in developed countries, condoms are the most popular method of birth control of married contraceptive users rely on condoms. In the average less developed country, condoms are less common only of married contraceptive users choose condoms. The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the later th century. Early th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases. During World War I, the United States and at the beginning of the war only Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use. However, European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population. Through the s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes. Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure. Worldwide, condom sales doubled in the s. Throughout World War II, condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but also heavily promoted with films, posters, and lectures. European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in. In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of non sexual uses for the devices, many of which continue to this day. After learning in the early s that AIDS can be a sexually transmitted infection, the use of condoms was encouraged to prevent transmission of HIV. Despite opposition by some political, religious, and other figures, national condom promotion campaigns occurred in the U.S. and Europe. These campaigns increased condom use significantly. Worldwide condom use is expected to continue to grow one study predicted that developing nations would need. billion condoms by. As of September, condoms are available inside prisons in Canada, most of the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, and the US states of Vermont on September, the Californian Senate approved a bill for condom distribution inside the state s prisons, but the bill was not yet law at the time of approval. The term condom first appears in the early th century. Its etymology is unknown. In popular tradition, the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of England s King Charles II, one Dr. Condom or Earl of Condom. There is however no evidence of the existence of such a person, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne. Some moral and scientific criticism of condoms exists despite the many benefits of condoms agreed on by scientific consensus and sexual health experts. Roman Catholic Church opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by direct and intentional acts for example, surgery to prevent conception or foreign objects for example, condoms. The Roman Catholic Church is the largest organized body of any world religion. The church has hundreds of programs dedicated to fighting the AIDS epidemic in Africa, but its opposition to condom use in these programs has been highly controversial. As an example, Latino immigrants in the United States often face cultural barriers to condom use. A study on female HIV prevention published in the Journal of Sex Health Research asserts that Latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender role norms in the Latino community, and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners. Women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general machismo subtly encouraged in Latino culture, their male partners would be angry or possibly violent at the woman s suggestion that they use condoms. A similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low income American black women the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used. Middle Eastern couples who have not had children, because of the strong desire and social pressure to establish fertility as soon as possible within marriage, rarely use condoms. Construction of the first four ships was plagued with difficulties as the Soviet shipbuilding and related industries were not prepared to build such large ships. One battleship, Sovetskaya Belorussiya, was cancelled on October after serious construction flaws were found. Construction of the other three ships was suspended shortly after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June, and never resumed. All three of the surviving hulls were scrapped in the late s. The machinery arrangement provided good dispersal of the machinery spaces, but at the cost of very long runs for the wing shafts ca. meters. ft. The turbine compartments for the wing shafts were located forward of boiler room No. and aft of the No. turret magazines. The engine room for the center shaft s turbine was between boiler room No. and No.. This meant that the wing propeller shafts had to run underneath the boilers. Maximum speed was estimated at knots, using the revised propeller design, although forcing the machinery would yield an extra knot. The normal fuel oil capacity was, metric tons, long tons, giving an estimated endurance of, nautical miles, km, mi at. knots. km h. mph and, nautical miles, km, mi at full speed. Maximum fuel capacity was, metric tons, long tons which gave a range of, nautical miles, km, mi at. knots and, nautical miles, km, mi at full speed. The main armament consisted of three electrically powered MK triple turrets, each with three caliber mm B guns. The guns could be depressed to and elevated to. They had a fixed loading angle of and their rate of fire varied with the time required to re aim the guns. It ranged from. to. rounds per minute depending on the elevation. The turrets could elevate at a rate of. degrees per second and traverse at. degrees per second. rounds per gun were carried. The guns fired, kilogram, lb projectiles at a muzzle velocity of m s, ft s this provided a maximum range of, meters, yd. The secondary armament consisted of twelve caliber B mm guns mounted in six dual MK turrets. Their elevation limits were to with a fixed loading angle of. Their rate of fire also varied with the elevation from. to. rounds per minute. They were provided with rounds per gun. The turrets could elevate at a rate of degrees per second and traverse at degrees per second. They had a maximum range of about, meters, ft with a kilogram lb shell at a muzzle velocity of m s, ft s. Soviet armor plate plants proved incapable of producing plates of cemented armor thicker than mm. in which forced the decision to replace cemented plates thicker than mm. in with face hardened ones with less resistance in November. The plants tended to compensate by making the thicker plates harder, but this often made them more brittle and large numbers did not pass the acceptance tests. This would have significantly reduced the level of protection enjoyed by the Sovetsky Soyuz class ships in combat. The forecastle deck was mm thick while the upper deck was mm. in over the citadel. Below it, the mm middle deck acted as a splinter deck. The upper deck was mm thick above the mm waterline belt extension. The bottom edge of the forward splinter belt met with a mm. in arched deck. Another arched deck of the same thickness covered the stern aft of the rear transverse bulkhead. Construction of all three ships was ordered halted on July, and the Sovetsky Soyuz was placed into long term conservation as the most advanced ship. However, all three were officially stricken from the Navy List on September. Underneath is the twelfth episode of the ninth season of the American science fiction television series The X Files. The episode first aired in the United States on March, on the Fox network. The episode was written and directed by executive producer John Shiban. The episode is a monster of the week episode, a stand alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of The X Files. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of. and was viewed by. million households and. million viewers. It received mixed reviews from critics. Underneath marked the directorial debut of Shiban, who had been a writer for the series for several seasons. Reportedly, the episode contained so many problems that the Fox executives nearly refused to allow the finished product to air. At the last minute, however, they relented, and allowed the episode to be aired later on in the season, several weeks after its intended air date. Shiban originally wanted to film the sewer scenes in Los Angeles actual sewer system, but due to the events of September, a sewer mock up was built on Stage at the Fox studios. Underneath was written and directed by executive producer John Shiban. This marked his directorial debut. According to Shiban, part of the inspiration for the episode was that the series production staff had actually talked for some time about doing a Jekyll Hyde story but never quite found a way to do it until the idea to use DNA came into play. Another inspiration for the episode was the film The Third Man, which featured a climactic chase through a sewage system. The Third Street Bridge is the major crossing of the creek, carrying T Third Street light rail line and Third Street. It is a bascule type drawbridge. The Port of San Francisco extended Illinois Street across Islais Creek in to relieve traffic for Third Street. This crossing also uses a bascule bridge. The cladogram below follows an analysis by Andrew McDonald,. Only two species assigned to Iguanodon are still considered to be valid. Two species described by Richard Lydekker in the late th century have been reassigned to different genera. Two Iguanodon species are currently considered to be nomina dubia Subtropical Storm Alpha also called Alfa was a rare off season subtropical cyclone that hit Georgia in May. It developed from a previously non tropical cyclone in the western Atlantic Ocean, and initially it moved northeastward off of the Carolinas. The storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge, and concurrently it intensified to become Subtropical Storm Alpha. It later moved ashore near Savannah, and it finally dissipated in the northeast Gulf of Mexico on May. It produced wave action and moderate rainfall along the coast. Damage totaled over, USD, and there were two associated deaths. The National Hurricane Center initially thought the center might not have been at the surface, and the agency indicated low forecasting confidence, as they could not determine a circulation center. The difficulty arose from the large, sprawling nature of the storm, and by later on May a new center formed, as confirmed by radar imagery and the Hurricane Hunters. That night, the extremely small center made landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia, affecting a very small area with winds of mph km h and a minimum pressure of mbar hPa. inHg. Around the time of landfall, Alpha developed a warm core, indicating some tropical characteristics. The storm weakened quickly over land, although it did not dissipate until two days later over the northeast Gulf of Mexico. Barbarian II The Dungeon of Drax is a video game first published in for various home computers. It was also released as Axe of Rage in North America. The game is the sequel to Barbarian The Ultimate Warrior Death Sword in North America, which was published in. In Barbarian II, the player controls a princess or barbarian character, exploring the game world to locate and defeat an evil wizard. The game s plot is an extension of its predecessor, although the gameplay is different. While the first game offers two players the opportunity for virtual head to head combat, the second is solely a single player adventure with fewer fighting moves. When Barbarian II was released, Palace Software went ahead with plans for Barbarian III. For two years, the third game in the series was publicised in gaming magazines. Your Sinclair held a contest for its readers, asking them to submit concepts of gruesome monsters. The winning entry would be implemented in Barbarian III. The Barbarian series of games were, however, brought to a halt in when Palace Group sold its software subsidiary to fund its expansion into the movie industry. Titus Software bought Palace Software and after reviewing its holdings, cancelled several of its new acquisition s projects, including Barbarian III. The book was selected as Editor s Choice in the Sunday Age. Publishers Weekly s review of the book was critical of its adulatory tone, but called it a necessity for fans, due the inclusion of the discography. A review of the book for The Boston Globe commented The value of the book is that it has at its heart the same subjects that most of Morrison s music has featured... religion and spirituality. The Palm Beach Post noted that the biography provides insights and updates as well as a solid background on Morrison s early life. The Sunday Times wrote that the really interesting story here is told by the photographs. The Irish Times was critical of the book s text but wrote positively of the included photographs. Prior to his work on the biography, Steve Turner had previously written a book about the music group U, titled U Rattle Hum, and Eric Clapton, titled Conversations With Eric Clapton. Turner first met Van Morrison in, while writing a book on religion s place in rock music. Turner characterised himself as someone who is drawn to artists bothered by spiritual issues. In his research for the book, the author interviewed approximately people that knew Van Morrison. Turner spoke with Van Morrison, and they discussed the musician s views on philosophy. Some of the photographs included in the book were obtained by Turner from a guitarist with Van Morrison s band Them. Steve Turner appeared on a panel of experts in the documentary Van Morrison Under Review. Along with Turner was Johnny Rogan, author of the biographies Van Morrison A Portrait of the Artist and Van Morrison No Surrender. The introduction to the book includes an analysis by the author of Van Morrison s skill to use the stuff of his life. Turner compares Van Morrison with other musicians of the time period, including Robbie Robertson, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young. The book s chapters contain a pictorial overview of the musician s professional work. The book s chapters are structured according to record releases of the musician. Pictures include images from locations where Van Morrison grew up in Belfast, contact prints from a photo shoot for a cover album with his wife at the time Janet Planet, and archived marketing photographs of a younger Van Morrison. The beginning of the book includes close up shots of the musician. The book also contains a complete discography of Van Morrison s work. The book notes the artist s reluctance to be interviewed or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying It s very hard for me to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don t have anything to do with my life... It s a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music. Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role I just feel I m doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show... It s more emotional for the audience... what they sort of think you are. He states that one of his motivations is ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think. The original soundtrack album has been hailed as an excellent video game music album, while the Chrono Cross Music Selection mini album has garnered little attention. Songs from the soundtrack have been played at various orchestral concerts, such as the personal arrangements by Mitsuda for the Play, A Video Game Symphony concert series. Chrono Cross music has also been extensively remixed by fans, and such remixes have been included in both official and unofficial albums. Track listing In, Mitsuda announced a new arranged album of Chrono Cross music was scheduled for release in July of that year. It did not materialize, though at a Play, A Video Game Symphony concert in May, he revealed it would be out within the year and would feature acoustic music. Later in, Mitsuda alleged that the album would actually be released in. In, Yasunori Mitsuda posted a streaming sample of a track from the upcoming Chrono Cross arranged album. Though no official release date was announced, Mitsuda more than once stated that the album would be planned to coincide with the th anniversary of the game s original release in. Mitsuda claimed that the album was nearly done, but that it may not be possible to release it before the year was out. First designated by July, along a different routing, M was extended several times in both directions through the s and s. Two of these extensions replaced sections of M in the Bay City area. At the apex of its length in the s, M stretched from Webberville in the south to Bay City State Park in the north. Since Interstate I opened in the Tri Cities area, the northern section of M was rerouted and truncated as a result of related changes to other highways. The southern end was moved after I opened in the Lansing area. Further changes into the s shortened M more, producing the routing in use today. In June, a construction project began on the interchange with US at the route s northern terminus. This construction consisted of bridge replacement over US, as well as a new ramp connecting northbound M to westbound US that, unlike the old ramp, does not conflict with westbound traffic exiting onto southbound M. All exits are unnumbered. Mosley is the youngest son of Sir Oswald Mosley, former leader of the British Union of Fascists BUF, and Diana Mitford. He was educated in France, Germany and Britain before going on to attend university at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with a degree in physics. He then changed to law and was called to the Bar in. In his teens and early twenties Mosley was involved with his father s post war political party, the Union Movement UM. He has said that the association of his surname with fascism stopped him from developing his interest in politics further, although he briefly worked for the Conservative Party in the early s. Mosley has rarely discussed his early political involvement with his father. When his father Oswald died, the London Daily Mail described him as a much maligned and much misunderstood political giant of his era. Certainly, his father s political presence affected his early years but Mosley reflected on this time, I was born into this rather strange family and then at a certain point you get away from that. Whilst he has distanced himself from this period of his life, the misunderstanding has remained and today... he carries that weight on his shoulders. In the early s, Mosley attempted a political career, working for the UK Conservative Party and hoping to become a parliamentary candidate. Bernie Ecclestone s biographer, Terry Lovell, writes that he gave up this aspiration after being unimpressed by the calibre of senior party officials. He also felt his name would be a handicap and has since said If I had a completely open choice in my life, I would have chosen party politics, but because of my name, that s impossible. By the late s he had become a supporter of the UK Labour Party, following a meeting with then Labour Leader John Smith. While Mosley was at University, his wife was given tickets to a motor race at the Silverstone Circuit. The circuit is not far from Oxford, and the couple went out of curiosity. Mosley was attracted by the sport, and when his career as a barrister was bringing in sufficient money, he started racing cars himself. The sport s indifference to his background appealed to Mosley The revised directive went into force in June, and banned sponsorship from, with a further three year extension for global sports such as Formula One. On October, the directive was successfully overturned in the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it was unlawful. A new Tobacco Advertising Directive took effect in July the Financial Times described Mosley as furious that this was a year earlier than provided for under the directive. As of, Ferrari is the only F team to retain tobacco sponsorship, although the team carries no explicit branding in races because of the European legislation. Although the FIA moved its headquarters out of the EU in, it returned in all of the F teams remain in Europe, and six are in the UK, compared to seven of eleven at the end of. In February, Mosley announced his intention to stand again for the presidency in October of that year, saying that if successful this third term would be his last. In December, Mosley said that he still intended to stand down when his term ran out in October, but would take the final decision in June of that year. Mosley s close relationship with Ecclestone, the sport s promoter, was criticised in early by Sir Jackie Stewart, who suggested that Mosley should resign in favour of a CEO from outside motorsport.

It provides engineering support to the United States Army Pacific command. The brigade specializes in bridging operations. The Brigade s Headquarters and Headquarters Company is stationed at Schofield Barracks and permanently commands two subordinate battalions. The th Engineer Battalion and the th Engineer Battalion are both located at Schofield Barracks. The total force of the brigade and its subordinate elements is approximately,. As the brigade is modular in nature, it is able to take command and control of more units when deployed. The regiment was re designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, th Engineer Aviation Brigade in Japan on July before being activated in September of that year. Only a few months later, this brigade was inactivated on June without having seen any deployment. The brigade took command of the th, th and th Engineer battalions. The th Engineer Brigade returned to Schofield Barracks Hawaii from Iraq on June. Corythosaurus is known from many complete specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in. The holotype skeleton is only missing the last section of the tail, and part of the forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these. The two species of Corythosaurus are both present in slightly different levels of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Both still co existed with theropods and other ornithischians, like Daspletosaurus, Brachylophosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Scolosaurus, and Chasmosaurus. The lower jaw of the holotype is. centimetres. in long, and centimetres. in deep. The total length of the crest from the beak to the uppermost tip of the type specimen is. centimetres. in, its total length is. centimetres. in, and height. centimetres. in. The D version ranked at No. in the Japanese box office chart with a total of, from a total of nine theaters. The D version won the Movie award for The Japanese Committee of the International D Society. The Winston Tunnel is a railroad tunnel located miles. kilometers west of Elizabeth, Illinois. The Winston Tunnel still exists, although in a very isolated area, and in a very deteriorated condition. Nature has reclaimed the right of way the fan house, unused since the s and severely damaged by the elements, was demolished in early and the eastern bore, located on private property, has been almost completely sealed with earth. The governing body, the Welsh Rugby Union WRU, was established in, the same year that Wales played their first international against England. Wales performances in the Home Nations Championship now the Six Nations continued to improve, experiencing their first golden age between and. They first played New Zealand, known as the All Blacks, in, when they defeated them in a famous match at Cardiff Arms Park. Welsh rugby struggled between the two World Wars, but experienced a second golden age between and when they won eight Five Nations Championships. Wales played in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in where they achieved their best ever result of third. Following the sport allowing professionalism in, Wales hosted the World Cup and, in, won their first ever Six Nations Grand Slam. That was the first Grand Slam won by a team playing most of the matches away from home. Wales won two more Grand Slams in and in, and in came fourth in the Rugby World Cup. Their home ground is the Millennium Stadium, currently known for sponsorship reasons as Principality Stadium, completed in to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park. Eight former Welsh players have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame ten were inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame prior to its merger into the World Rugby Hall. In, Wales again won the Home Championship, and later that year played the South African national side, the Springboks for the first time. Wales were favourites to win the match, but instead South Africa dominated in the forwards and eventually won. Two years later, on December, Wales played the touring Australians, the Wallabies, who they defeated. In, Wales won the Home Championship and then, in with the inclusion of France the first ever Five Nations. In, Wales took the first Five Nations Grand Slam by winning all their matches in the Five Nations France were heavily defeated by Wales at St Helens in and Ivor Morgan scored two tries in the match. It would be nearly forty years before they achieved a Grand Slam again. England s defeat of Wales at Cardiff in was Wales first home loss to one of the Home Nations since, and their first home loss to England since. The Great War came in and rugby was suspended for the duration. In the Five Nations Championship, Wales and Scotland refused to travel to Ireland at the height of the Troubles after receiving threats, purportedly from the Irish Republican Army. The Championship remained unresolved with Wales and Ireland unbeaten. Although the Five Nations was a five way tie in, the Welsh did defeat Australia in Cardiff. Wales next won the Five Nations outright in, and in, Wales won their second Grand slam of the decade. Just like the first in, they only used players over their four matches. They repeated the feat in and, in the process, became the first team to win three consecutive Triple Crowns. Following their final Five Nations match of, both Phil Bennett and Gareth Edwards retired from rugby. In, the WRU s centenary year, Wales lost to the All Blacks in Cardiff by after the All Blacks scored four tries to nil. Wales won two matches in each Five Nations of and, and in were nearly upset by Japan winning at Cardiff. In, Australia defeated Wales at Cardiff Arms Park and in the process scored a push over try. Australia went on to win their first Home Nations Grand Slam. At the World Cup, Wales reached the tournament semi finals for the first time since where they lost to France after a red card for captain Sam Warburton. The two teams met again in March, where Wales needed a win to claim their third Six Nations Grand Slam in eight years, which they did with a victory. This was followed immediately by an eight match losing streak, which was eventually broken during the Six Nations, where Wales retained the Championship for the first time since wins. Wales reached the quarter finals of the World Cup at the expense of hosts England, then lost to South Africa. By, the WRU had concluded that a new national ground was needed due to flooding that often plagued Arms Park. After debate and disputes between the WRU and various other parties, including Cardiff RFC, in the s, it was decided that a new national stadium would be built with a new ground for the Cardiff club backing onto it. The National Stadium, as it was known, was officially opened in. Wales compete annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations England, France, Ireland, Italy, and Scotland. The Six Nations started as the Home Nations Championship in, as a contest between the four component nations of the United Kingdom. Wales first won it in, when they achieved a Triple Crown. Wales have won the tournament outright times, and shared eleven other victories. Their longest wait between championships was years. Wales first won a Grand Slam in although France did not officially join the Five Nations until and their first Six Nations Grand Slam in. Their latest Grand Slam was won against France on March, and they claimed their most recent Triple Crown on February against England. Wales have won of their Test matches for a. winning record. Their biggest Test defeat was loss to South Africa in, and their largest victory a defeat of Japan in. Their record for most tries in a match is, scored against Portugal in they also scored points in this match, more than in any other Test. Wales record for consecutive Test wins is eleven, and for consecutive losses is ten. Below is table summary of Wales Test matches up until June. On May, Warren Gatland named a man squad for their June test series against New Zealand, pre tour test against England and the mid week match against the Chiefs. On June, Aaron Jarvis was called up to the squad as injury cover for Paul James. Jarvis later became a permanent replacement after James failed to recover form his injury. Anekntavda is one of the three Jain doctrines of relativity used for logic and reasoning. The other two are sydvda the theory of conditioned predication and nayavda the theory of partial standpoints. These Jain philosophical concepts made important contributions to ancient Indian philosophy, especially in the areas of skepticism and relativity. syd asti in some ways, it is, syn nsti in some ways, it is not, syd asti nsti in some ways, it is, and it is not, syd asti avaktavya in some ways, it is, and it is indescribable, syn nsti avaktavya in some ways, it is not, and it is indescribable, syd asti nsti avaktavya in some ways, it is, it is not, and it is indescribable, syd avaktavya in some ways, it is indescribable.

The Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery, more commonly known as the Airborne Cemetery, is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in Oosterbeek, near Arnhem, the Netherlands. It was established in and is home to graves from the Second World War. Most of the men buried in the cemetery were Allied servicemen killed in the Battle of Arnhem, an Allied attempt to cross the Rhine in, or in the liberation of the city the following year. Men killed in these battles are still discovered in the surrounding area even in the st century, and so the number of people interred in the cemetery continues to grow. The Ace Attorney series launched in Japan with the Game Boy Advance game Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney in, and has been published in the West since the release of a Nintendo DS port in. The series currently consists of six main series games and four spin offs. Additionally, two titles that collect the first three main series games have been released Ace Attorney Phoenix Wright Trilogy HD, which was released for iOS in in Japan and in in the West, and Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy, which was released for the Nintendo DS in. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney is the first entry in the series. It was originally released for the Game Boy Advance in in Japan it has also been released for the Nintendo DS in, Microsoft Windows in, and the Wii and iOS in. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Justice for All is the second entry in the series. It was originally released for the Game Boy Advance in in Japan it has also been released for the Nintendo DS in, Microsoft Windows in, and the Wii in. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations is the third entry in the series. It was originally released for the Game Boy Advance in in Japan it has also been released for Microsoft Windows in, the Nintendo DS in, and the Wii in. Apollo Justice Ace Attorney is the fourth entry in the series. It was released for the Nintendo DS in in Japan and in in the West. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Dual Destinies is the fifth entry in the main series. It was originally released for the Nintendo DS in in Japan, North America and Europe outside of Japan, it was given a digital only release. An iOS version was released in in Japan and the West. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Spirit of Justice is the sixth entry in the main series. It was released for the Nintendo DS in in Japan, and is planned to be released later in the year in North America and Europe outside of Japan, it will be a digital only release. Ace Attorney Investigations Miles Edgeworth is the first entry in the Investigations spin off series. It was released for the Nintendo DS in in Japan and in in the West. Ace Attorney Investigations is the second entry in the Investigations series. It was released for the Nintendo DS in in Japan, but has not been released in the West. Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney is a crossover between Ace Attorney and the Professor Layton series. It was released for the Nintendo DS in in Japan and in in the West. The Ace Attorney games are visual novel adventure games in which the player controls defense attorneys and defends their clients in several different episodes. The gameplay is split into two types of sections investigations and courtroom trials. During the investigations, the player searches the environments, gathering information and evidence, and talks to characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. Once enough evidence has been collected, the game moves on to a courtroom trial section. Takumi felt that the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them together into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game s story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix s personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own. Dual Destinies was given a digital only release in the West. This was partially because of the game s tight development schedule by releasing it digitally, Capcom was able to release the English version close to the Japanese release date. Two of the games have not been localized Ace Attorney Investigations and Dai Gyakuten Saiban, although the former has received a full fan translation. The Ace Attorney series has been well received by critics, and has performed well commercially in December, it was Capcom s th best selling series of all time, and in October, they called it one of their strongest intellectual properties, with more than. million units sold worldwide. By December, the series had sold over million units. In the United States, the first game became surprisingly successful, forcing Capcom to prepare at least three additional runs to meet the demand. Even before the supply conduit through Sihanoukville was shut down, PAVN had begun expanding its logistical system from southeastern Laos the Ho Chi Minh trail into northeastern Cambodia. PAVN also launched an offensive Campaign X against the Cambodian army, quickly seizing large portions of the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, isolating and besieging or overrunning a number of Cambodian cities including Kampong Cham. Communist forces then approached within miles km of the capital, Phnom Penh, spurring President Nixon into action. The main problems were the pressure of time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days notice. The following evening, Nixon decided that We would go for broke and gave his authorization for the incursion. The joint U.S. ARVN campaign would begin on May with the stated goals of reducing allied casualties in South Vietnam assuring the continued withdrawal of U.S. forces and enhancing the U.S. Saigon government position at the peace negotiations in Paris. In order to keep the campaign as low key as possible, General Abrams had suggested that the commencement of the incursion be routinely announced from Saigon. At on April, however, President Nixon appeared on all three U.S. television networks to announce that It is not our power but our will and character that is being tested tonight and that the time has come for action. He announced his decision to launch American forces into Cambodia with the special objective of capturing COSVN, the headquarters of the entire communist military operation in South Vietnam. COSVN as a single headquarters for control of PAVN operations in South Vietnam probably did not exist, or, at least, was never found. Opposition to the incursion was expected to be heavy, but PAVN NLF forces had begun moving westward two days before the advance began. By May, MACV reported only eight Americans killed and wounded, low casualties for such a large operation. There was only scattered and sporadic contact with delaying forces such as that experienced by elements of the U.S. th Armoured Cavalry three kilometers inside Cambodia. PAVN troops opened fire with small arms and rockets only to be blasted by tank fire and tactical airstrikes. When the smoke had cleared, dead PAVN soldiers were counted on the battlefield while only two U.S. troops were killed during the action. The North Vietnamese had ample notice of the impending attack. A March directive from the headquarters of the B Front, captured during the incursion, ordered PAVN NLF forces to break away and avoid shooting back... Our purpose is to conserve forces as much as we can. The only surprised party amongst the participants in the incursion seemed to be Lon Nol, who had been informed by neither Washington nor Saigon concerning the impending invasion of his country. He only discovered the fact after a telephone conversation with the head of the U.S. mission, who had found out about it himself from a radio broadcast. After the first week of operations, additional battalion and brigade units were committed to the operation, so that between and May, a total of, Allied troops including U.S. maneuver battalions were conducting operations inside Cambodia. Due to increasing political and domestic turbulence in the U.S., President Nixon issued a directive on May limiting the distance and duration of U.S. operations to a depth of kilometers mi and setting a deadline of June for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces to South Vietnam. Aerial operations for the incursion got off to a slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border. Within two months, however, the limit of the operational area was extended past the Mekong, and U.S. tactical aircraft were soon directly supporting Cambodian forces in the field. These missions were officially denied by the U.S. and false coordinates were given in official reports to hide their existence. Defense Department records indicated that out of more than, combat sorties flown in Cambodia between July and February, approximately percent were flown outside the authorized Freedom Deal boundary. The Cambodian government was not informed of the incursion until it was already under way. It has been argued by some scholars that the incursion heated up the civil war and helped the insurgent Khmer Rouge gather recruits to their cause.

Traditional etymology links Varanasi to the names of two Ganges tributaries forming the city s borders Varuna, still flowing in northern Varanasi, and Assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat. The old city is located on the north shores of the Ganges, bounded by Varuna and Assi. Over most of the last millennium, the city was known as Banaras. In the s, Indian government decided to return to the Sanskrit form Varanasi however, Banaras is still the predominant form used locally. According to the City Development Plan for Varanasi, approximately of Varanasi s population is employed. Approximately are employed in manufacturing, work in trade and commerce, work in other services, work in transport and communication, work in agriculture, work in construction, and are marginal workers working for less than half of the year. Among manufacturing workers, work in spinning and weaving, work in metal, work in printing and publishing, work in electrical machinery, and the rest work in a wide variety of industry sectors. Varanasi s manufacturing industry is not well developed and is dominated by small scale industries and household production. further information at Religion in Varanasi Among the estimated, temples in Varanasi, the temples most popular for worship are the Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Shiva the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple and the Durga Temple, known for monkeys that reside in the large trees nearby. Varanasi is twinned with In, the British Government funded the installation of a magnetic observatory at Greenwich. The Association continued to press for the construction of similar observatories around the world, and in their suggestions were accepted by the Government and funds were provided. In the British Government and the Royal Society prepared four expeditions to build magnetic observation stations in Cape Town St. Helena Hobart, Tasmania and eventually Toronto. Teams of Royal Artillery officers were sent out to take the measurements. The team assigned to Canada originally planned to build their observatory on Saint Helen s Island off Montreal, but the local rocks proved to have a high magnetic influence, and the decision was made to move to Toronto instead. The team arrived in, and set up camp at Fort York in a disused barracks while construction started on new buildings. The observatory was given acres. ha of land to the west of King s College the Ontario Legislature now occupies the area on which the college was located. In the Royal Society s project was concluded, and the observatory was set to be abandoned. After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station see Meteorological Service of Canada under the direction of the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure. The Atlantic hurricane season was the first season to use the Saffir Simpson hurricane scale, a scale developed in by Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson to rate the intensity of tropical cyclones. The season produced tropical and subtropical cyclones, of which only reached storm intensity, became hurricanes, and only reached major hurricane status. Although more active than the season, brought few storms of note. Nearly half of the season s storms affected land, one of which resulted in severe damage. The first storm of the hurricane season, forming in mid April, developed more than a month before the official start of the season. Several other short lived, weak depressions formed before and during June however, none reached storm intensity. The first named storm, Alice, formed on July. Tracking generally to the north, Alice also became the first hurricane of the season as well as the first known cyclone to impact Bermuda during July. Shortly after Alice dissipated over Atlantic Canada, another depression formed. By the end of July, two more non developing depressions formed and the first subtropical cyclone, given the name Alfa, developed off the east coast of the United States. This storm was short lived and dissipated on August just offshore southern Maine. The first half August was relatively quiet, with only one depression forming. However, later in the month, the season s second hurricane, Brenda, formed in the northwestern Caribbean. Peaking just below Category status on the newly introduced Saffir Simpson hurricane scale, Brenda made the first recorded landfall in the Mexican State of Campeche. Later in August, Tropical Storm Christine became the easternmost forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin on record, developing over the western African country of Guinea on August. The system traveled for several thousand miles before dissipating in the eastern Caribbean Sea in early September. At the start of the month, a new tropical storm formed in the Gulf of Mexico. This storm, named Delia, became the first known cyclone to make landfall in the same city twice. After moving inland a second time, Delia eventually dissipated on September. As Delia dissipated another depression formed in the same region, eventually making landfall in the same city as Delia, Freeport, Texas. Another brief depression formed several days later. On September, the strongest storm of the season, Ellen, formed over the eastern Atlantic. After tracking northwest for several days, Ellen eventually attained hurricane status as it turned westward. Several days later, the hurricane turned northeast due to an approaching frontal system. Shortly before becoming extratropical, Ellen reached major hurricane intensity at a record northerly latitude. In late September, a brief depression affected northern Florida before dissipating. After a week of inactivity, the second subtropical storm of the year formed over the central Atlantic. This storm, named Bravo, gradually intensified, becoming fully tropical, at which time it was renamed Fran, a few days later. Upon being renamed, Fran had intensified into a hurricane and maintained this intensity for several days before dissipating east of the Azores on October. A few days after Fran dissipated, the final named storm of the year formed in the central Caribbean Sea. A slow moving system, Gilda gradually intensified just below hurricane intensity before striking Cuba and moving over the Bahamas. A few days after passing through the islands, Gilda became the first storm on record to transition from a tropical cyclone into a subtropical cyclone. A large storm, Gilda eventually became extratropical near Atlantic Canada and dissipated later that month. Around the time Gilda was dissipating, a weak depression briefly existed near the Azores. The final storm of the year was a strong depression in the southern Caribbean Sea. This system was active for less than two days but may have briefly attained tropical storm intensity as it made landfall in southern Nicaragua. On July, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of mph km h and a barometric pressure of mbar hPa. inHg, as the eastern portion of the eyewall brushed Bermuda. After passing the island, Alice began to accelerate in response to a mid level trough over the eastern United States and weakened. By July, winds head decreased below hurricane intensity as the storm neared Atlantic Canada. Later that day, Alice made landfall in eastern Newfoundland with winds of mph km h before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Once back over water, Brenda began to intensify, attaining hurricane status late on August. The next day, a well defined eye had developed and the storm attained its peak intensity as a high end Category hurricane with winds of mph km h and a minimum pressure of mbar hPa. inHg. The storm made landfall later that day near Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico at this intensity, becoming the first hurricane on record to strike the region. After moving inland, Brenda rapidly weakened to a depression by the morning of August and dissipated later that day. Already suffering from severe flooding that killed at least people and left, homeless, Hurricane Brenda worsened the situation with torrential rainfall and additional flooding. The storm killed at least people in the country. Following the damage wrought by Brenda, a large earthquake struck the region, hampering relief efforts and collapsing numerous structures. Winds on land gusted up to mph km h, leading to severe wind damage. Two of the fatalities occurred in Campeche after of the city was flooded. This was considered the worst flooding in the city in over years. An estimated, people were left homeless as a direct result of Brenda throughout Mexico. Offshore, a freighter with crewman became trapped in the storm after its engines failed. They were safely rescued several days later once the storm had dissipated. The easternmost forming Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, Tropical Storm Christine, originated as a tropical wave over Africa in mid August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned a tropical depression at. W, over the country of Guinea, unlike most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles over water before spawning a depression. Although it was already a depression, advisories on the storm were not issued until August, five days after its formation. For several days, the depression maintained its intensity as it steadily tracked west across the Atlantic. It eventually attained tropical storm intensity on August. Despite the lack of aircraft reconnaissance in the region, the intensity was determined by wind readings from a German cargo ship that passed through the storm. On August, the first reconnaissance mission into the storm found tropical storm force winds and the first advisory was issued that day, immediately declaring the system as Tropical Storm Christine. Three days later, Christine attained its peak intensity just below hurricane status with winds of mph km h and a minimum pressure of mbar hPa. inHg. Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands. As it passed over Antigua on September, Christine weakened to a tropical depression and eventually dissipated near the Dominican Republic later that day. Due to the erratic track of the storm along the Texas coastline, widespread heavy rains fell in areas near the storm and in Louisiana. Tides up to ft. m, in addition to rainfall up to. in mm, caused significant flooding in the Galveston Freeport area. Up to million was reported in damages to homes due to the flooding. Throughout Louisiana, there was substantial flooding of farmland. Damages to crops amounted to million. In addition to the flooding rains produced by Delia, eight tornadoes also touched down due to the storm, injuring four people. Five people were killed during Delia, two drowned during floods, two died in a car accident and the other died from a heart attack while boarding up his home. On September, a tropical depression formed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea within a trough of low pressure extended southeastward from Delia, which was situated over southeast Texas at the time. The depression remained weak until it reached the Texas coastline on September. Once onshore, it produced significant rainfall, causing significant damage that was attributed to Tropical Storm Delia. After turning northeast and tracking inland, the depression quickly increased in forward speed before dissipating over North Carolina on September. The strongest storm of the season, Hurricane Ellen, began as a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on September. On the following day, the wave spawned an area of low pressure south of the Cape Verde Islands that quickly became a tropical depression. Tracking northeast, the system intensified into a tropical storm on September after sustained winds of mph km h were reported by a French naval vessel however, due to sparse data on the storm, the first advisory on Ellen was not issued for two more days. A slightly elongated storm, Ellen gradually intensified over the open Atlantic and was steered by two troughs of low pressure. On September, the storm took a nearly due west track and the system became increasingly organized, with an ill defined eye becoming present on satellite imagery. Heavy rain fell in association with the depression in parts of Florida and Georgia. A maximum of. in mm fell in Orlando while several other areas recorded over in mm of rain. Over land, wind gusts reached mph km h in some locations. Offshore, swells produced by the system reached ft. m, impacting several vessels in the region. Minor beach erosion and coastal flooding was reported in parts of South Carolina as a result of the storm. In parts of coastal Georgia, high water resulted in several road closures and flooded a few homes. Police officers in Savannah reported that wave were topping the local seawall however, no damage was reported. The final hurricane of the season, Fran, originated from an area of convection north of Hispaniola on October. By October, the system interacted with a mid tropospheric trough near the southeast United States, resulting in the formation of a surface low. Tracking eastward, showers and thunderstorms began to develop around the circulation however, the structure of the system was not fully tropical. Late on October, the cyclone had become sufficiently organized to be classified a subtropical depression. Cold air from the remnants of a cold front became entrained within the circulation however, the cold air gradually warmed. The following day, winds increased to gale force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. The precursor to Tropical Storm Gilda was a large convective system partially due to a tropical wave. It gradually became better organized over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and on October, a tropical depression formed off the coast of Nicaragua. As it drifted to the northeast, it strengthened to a tropical storm, peaking at mph km h winds. Before it hit the coast of Cuba, it weakened enough to cause only minor damage. By the time it struck the island, it had become very disorganized in nature. On October, cool, dry air entered the newly developed convection, and as a result it transitioned into a subtropical cyclone. Gilda became the first tropical system to pass through a subtropical stage prior to becoming extratropical. The large circulation continued northeast before becoming extratropical on October. The remnants of Gilda intensified as they tracked near Atlantic Canada, attaining a central pressure of mbar hPa. inHg near Cape Race, Newfoundland. The system eventually dissipated near southern Greenland on October. Gilda caused heavy rain and mudslides in Jamaica, destroying six homes and killing six people. In Cuba, Gilda dropped over in mm of rain, while mph km h winds were reported in the northern part of the country. In the Bahamas, Gilda caused significant crop damage from heavy rainfall and high tides. The storm s persistent strong currents and easterly winds caused moderate beach erosion on the East Coast of the United States, mostly along the Florida coast. The extratropical remnants of the storm produced hurricane force wind gusts over parts of Atlantic Canada, peaking at mph km h however, no damage was reported. On June, another depression formed along Florida, this time just onshore near the Georgia border. The system slowly tracked northeastward before dissipating on June southeast of the North South Carolina border. As Hurricane Alice neared Bermuda on July, a depression formed near the east coast of the United States however, the storm dissipated the following day. On July, the first Cape Verde storm formed over the central Atlantic. This system did not intensify, remaining a weak depression and dissipated on July without affecting land. The next day, a new depression formed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea near the coast of Nicaragua. The depression tracked over Central America, briefly moving back over water in the Gulf of Honduras before making a second landfall in Belize. The system persisted over land for a few days before entering the eastern Pacific late on July. Only one non developing depression formed during the month of August, an unusually eastward forming system. The depression was first identified just offshore eastern Africa on September, near where Tropical Storm Christine formed later in the month. Tracking rapidly towards the west, the depression dissipated on September over open waters. In addition to the two notable tropical depressions and two named storms in September, a slow moving depression formed south southeast of Bermuda on September. Tracking generally northward, the depression dissipated early on September without affecting land. Upon the declaration of Hurricane Fran on October, a new depression formed southwest of the strengthening hurricane. This system rapidly tracked northeast and dissipated two days later. Later that month, a slow moving depression formed near the Azores. This system tracked southeast and dissipated on October without affecting land. The final system of the year formed near the northern coast of Panama on November. The depression was noted as a... strong depression... by the National Hurricane Center and may have briefly attained tropical storm intensity before making landfall in southern Nicaragua on November the system dissipated later that day over land. The following names were used for named storms tropical storms and hurricanes that formed in the North Atlantic in. Storms were named Christine, Delia, Ellen and Fran for the first time in. Due to the relatively minimal impact caused by storms during the season, no names were retired in the spring of however, due to the addition of male names in, the list was removed and replaced with a new set of names. The following names were used for subtropical storms in the Atlantic basin for this year. This year was the second and last year to use the phonetic alphabet. Although a storm was given the name Bravo, it was renamed Fran after acquiring tropical characteristics. In late, amidst concerns of war in the Pacific, the unit was deployed north to Darwin in the Northern Territory, where they undertook garrison duties in the weeks following Japan s entry into the war. Following Japanese landings in Malaya, the th embarked from Darwin and were transferred to Malaya, arriving in Singapore in the final days of the fighting on the peninsula. In the wake of the withdrawal of British and Commonwealth forces to the island, the battalion was hastily deployed in support of the two Australian brigades the nd and th Brigades in the north western sector of the island. During the initial Japanese landing, elements of the battalion were heavily engaged around the landing beaches but they were outnumbered and over the course of the week the defenders were pushed back towards the centre of the island, towards the city of Singapore. They suffered heavy casualties during this time, before subsequently becoming prisoners of war after the fall of Singapore. Lieutenant Colonel Michael Anketell. The th Machine Gun Battalion received the following battle honours for its service during the Second World War Malaya, and Singapore. Nixon entered as the front runner for the Republican nomination. However, polls suggested that in a head to head match up with incumbent President Lyndon Johnson, Nixon trailed to. Later in January, Nixon embarked on a tour of Texas, where he lampooned President Johnson s State of the Union address, asking Can this nation afford to have four more years of Lyndon Johnson s policies that have failed at home and abroad, At this time, reports suggested that Nixon would formally announce his bid in February. In early June, Nixon continued to be regarded as the favorite to win the nomination, but observers noted that he had not yet locked up the nomination. He still faced challenges from Nelson Rockefeller and Ronald Reagan, and was not on the ballot in California, where Reagan won a large slate of delegates. Behind the scenes, Nixon staff lobbied for delegates from favorite son candidates, resulting, in the backing of Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, and his pledged delegates, as well as those delegates supporting Senator Charles Percy of Illinois. After the assassination of Robert Kennedy, like the other candidates, Nixon took a break from campaigning. Reports suggested that the assassination all but assured his nomination. Upon returning to the trail, Nixon found that Rockefeller had begun attacking him. Rockefeller described Nixon as a man of the old politics who has great natural capacity not to do the right thing, especially under pressure. Nixon refused to respond to the jabs, stating that he would not participate in attacks. As he edged closer to the nomination, discussions about his running mate arose. Republicans in the Midwest pushed for Mayor John Lindsay of New York City. The endorsement of Nixon by Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon raised speculation that he might be chosen. Congressman George Bush of Texas and Senator Percy were also mentioned as possible selections. At the end of the month, Nixon had two thirds of the required delegates necessary to win the nomination. On July, Nixon received the endorsement of Senator John G. Tower of Texas, handing him at least delegates. With his nomination all but assured, Nixon s ad team began preparing for the general election. A series of advertisements featuring question and answer sessions with Nixon and friends of campaign staffers were filmed in New York. The tapes were sent to the swing states of Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio, giving Nixon the advantage of advertising long before the Democratic Party settled on a candidate. At this time, Nixon decided with a group of legislators that crime and disorder would be presented as the number one issue in the nation. This continued to be a major theme of the Nixon campaign, and would continue to be used extensively during the general election. Nixon publicly announced his opposition to the military draft, proposing to replace the current system with a volunteer army encouraged with higher pay. President Eisenhower endorsed Nixon in mid July, breaking his tradition of waiting until after the primary, due to the election s importance. By July s end, reports circulated that Nixon had probable delegates for the convention, placing him over the delegate threshold, Rockefeller, however, disputed these numbers. Sources within Washington reported that Reagan caused greater concern for the Nixon campaign than Rockefeller. A possible scenario surfaced where Nixon s southern delegates would drop their support to back the more conservative Reagan. Nonetheless, Nixon staffers believed that if such a scenario occurred, liberal Rockefeller delegates in the Northeast would support Nixon to prevent a Reagan nomination. Following nomination, Nixon held his hands in the air with his trademark V sign of victory, delivering an acceptance speech written over the preceding weeks. In his speech, he remarked Before his visit, he called upon Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, the highest ranking African American in U.S. government, to campaign with him on trips to Illinois and California. Referring to Brooke as one of my top advisers, he accompanied campaign stops in Chicago and San Francisco, a move critics described as an attempt to further gain favor within the African American community. On May, the cyclone formed a new low pressure center and relocated roughly km mi south. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to accelerate towards the southeast and started to undergo an extratropical transition. Early on May, Herbie made landfall in Shark Bay before losing its identity the following day over the Great Australian Bight. Although a weak storm, Herbie brought flooding rains and severe dust storms to portions of Western Australia. Additionally, a, ton freighter broke in half amidst rough seas produced by the storm. Total losses from the storm reached A million. million USD. Due to the significant damage wrought by Herbie, the name was retired following its use. Around the same time, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, estimating the cyclone to have attained peak winds of km h mph minute sustained. On May, satellite imagery of the system depicted that a new low pressure centre had developed roughly km mi south of the original low. Several hours after the relocation, the JTWC downgraded Herbie to a tropical depression as the system s movement began to accelerate towards the southeast. As the storm moved at a rapid speed towards the coastline of Western Australia, it began to undergo an extratropical transition. During a hour period May Herbie tracked roughly, km mi, with the movement of the storm reaching km h mph at times. Late on May, the JTWC ceased advisories on the system as it weakened below tropical depression status offshore. However, the Bureau of Meteorology continued to monitor the system. Early on May, the center of Herbie made landfall in Shark Bay with wind gusts up to km h mph and a pressure of hPa mbar. Due to the rapid movement of the storm, it reached the Great Australian Bight while retaining tropical characteristics despite its low latitude. Early on May, the system lost its identity south of Australia as an extratropical cyclone. Croatia was first recognized as an independent state on June by Slovenia, which declared its own independence on the same day as Croatia. Lithuania followed on July, and Ukraine, Latvia, Iceland, and Germany in December. The EEC countries granted Croatia recognition on January, and the United Nations admitted them in May. The origins of the Georgian script are to this date poorly known, and no full agreement exists among Georgian and foreign scholars as to its date of creation, who designed the script and the main influences on that process. Another controversy regards the main influences at play in the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested as a possible inspiration for particular letters certain pre Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers. From the th century, the forms of some letters began to change. The equal height of the letters was abandoned, with letters acquiring ascenders and descenders. Note Some fonts show capitalized tall variants of Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli letters rather than Asomtavruli. Importance was attached also to the colour of the ink itself.

Mkhedruli letters are written in the four linear system, similar to Nuskhuri. Mkhedruli becomes more round and free in writing. It breaks the strict frame of the previous two alphabets, Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri. Mkhedruli letters begin to get coupled and more free calligraphy develops. The modern Georgian alphabet consists of letters Mkhedruli has been adapted to languages besides Georgian. Some of these alphabets retained letters obsolete in Georgian, while others required additional letters The following table shows the stroke order and direction of each Mkhedruli letter gani may be written like vini with a closed loop at the bottom. Rarely, oni is written as a right angle,. jani is sometimes written so that it looks like a hooked version of the Latin X Several letters are similar and may be confused at first, especially in handwriting. For vini and k ani, the critical difference is whether the top is a full arc or a more or less vertical line. Asomtavruli is often highly stylized and writers readily formed ligatures, intertwined letters, and placed letters within letters.

Banai is considered as a Dhangar, a sheep herding caste, and is sometimes regarded to be of celestial origin. Oral traditions chiefly discuss the tale of her marriage to Khandoba and her conflicts with his first wife Mhalsa. Banai is an antithesis of Mhalsa together they complete the god. Banai is generally depicted with Khandoba and often is also accompanied by Mhalsa. Banai does not enjoy independent worship, but is worshipped as Khandoba s consort in most of his temples. She is the patron goddess of the Dhangar community and is worshipped as a protector of their herds. Banai is an antithesis Mhalsa. Mhalsa has a regular ritualistic marriage with Khandoba. Banai, on the other hand, has a love marriage after being captured by the god. Mhalsa is described as pure, ugly, jealous and a good cook Banai is impure, erotic, resolute, but does not even know to cook. Mhalsa represents culture while Banai nature together they aid the god king Khandoba. Khandoba is often depicted with two identical goddesses accompanying him, representing Mhalsa and Banai. In brass images, Banai is depicted holding a lamb and offering water to Khandoba, while Mhalsa rides with Khandoba on his horse. In metal plaques worshipped by the Dhangars, Banai accompanies Khandoba on his horse and is depicted with sheep. Europium is the most reactive rare earth element. It rapidly oxidizes in air, so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter sized sample occurs within several days. Its reactivity with water is comparable to that of calcium, and the reaction is Eu HO Eu OH H Eu O EuO H Naturally occurring europium is composed of isotopes, Eu and Eu, with Eu being the most abundant. natural abundance. While Eu is stable, Eu was recently found to be unstable to alpha decay with half life of Europium is produced by nuclear fission, but the fission product yields of europium isotopes are low near the top of the mass range for fission products. Like other lanthanides, many isotopes, especially isotopes with odd mass numbers and neutron poor isotopes like Eu, have high cross sections for neutron capture, often high enough to be neutron poisons. A recent application of europium is in quantum memory chips which can reliably store information for days at a time these could allow sensitive quantum data to be stored to a hard disk like device and shipped around the country. North Eastern Area Command was one of several geographically based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force RAAF during World War II. For most of its existence it covered central and northern Queensland, and Papua New Guinea. It was formed in January from the eastern part of the former Northern Area Command, which had covered the whole of northern Australia and Papua. Headquartered at Townsville, Queensland, North Eastern Area Command was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. Aircraft under its control took part in the battles of Rabaul, Port Moresby and Milne Bay in, and the landings at Hollandia and Aitape in. The command continued to operate following the end of the war, before its responsibilities were subsumed in by the RAAF s new functional command and control system the headquarters was disbanded two years later. North Eastern Area Command was formed at Townsville, Queensland, on January, taking over the eastern portion of what was previously Northern Area Command. Northern Area had been established on May as one of the RAAF s geographically based command and control zones, and covered northern New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Papua. The roles of the area commands were air defence, protection of adjacent sea lanes, and aerial reconnaissance. Each area was led by an Air Officer Commanding AOC responsible for the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary. As of, the former NEA headquarters in Building, Green Street, housed Townsville s State Emergency Service group. As at April, NEA s order of battle comprised RAAF Station Townsville No. General Purpose Squadron No. Transport Squadron No. Fighter Squadron No. General Purpose Squadron RAAF Station Port Moresby No. General Reconnaissance Squadron No. General Reconnaissance Squadron No. General Reconnaissance Squadron No. Fighter Squadron No. Fighter Sector Headquarters, Townsville No. Fighter Sector Headquarters, Port Moresby The Cape lobster is endemic to South Africa. It occurs from Dassen Island, Western Cape in the west to Haga Haga, Eastern Cape in the east, a range of kilometres mi. Most of the known specimens were regurgitated by fish caught on reefs at depths of metres ft. This suggests that the Cape lobster inhabits rocky substrates, and may explain its apparent rarity, since such areas are not amenable to dredging or trawling, and the species may be too small to be retained by lobster traps. Homarinus capensis is considerably smaller than the large northern lobsters of the Atlantic Ocean, Homarus gammarus the European lobster and Homarus americanus the American lobster, at centimetres.. in total length, or cm.. in carapace length. Accounts of the colouration of H. capensis are very variable, from tawny, red or yellow to a rather dark olive, similar to Homarus gammarus. The first section of the PDR to be completed was the Southern Way Link Road in and the last section was the Butetown Link Road in. Construction of the first phase of the final link road, the Eastern Bay Link Road, started on March and is due to be completed by April. When fully completed, the road will form part of the Cardiff ring road system. The PDR runs west, south and east of Cardiff, with the M between junction and junction completing the northern section. The PDR is dual carriageway for its entire length except for the East Moors Viaduct, which is a single carriageway. This section partly opened in, from the Rover Way Lamby Way roundabout to the Llanedeyrn Interchange on the A is oldest section of the PDR. It includes only the Southern Way Link Road, known locally as Southern Way, and is. km. mi in length. A map of all the link roads and spur roads can be seen by clicking Map of all coordinates opposite Each section of the road was completed in separate link roads. The viaduct was designed by South Glamorgan County Council. Robert Benaim and Associates, now called Benaim UK Ltd designed the initial launching system for the glued segmental structure. The original route of the link road had been challenged by both Friends of the Earth Cymru, and also the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds RSPB, who had both lodged formal objections against the link road. However, the current proposal from Cardiff Council of October is to complete the first phase of the road, approximately km. mi in length, from the Butetown Link Road to Ocean Way roundabout. The new route would be a different route from the earlier proposal and would avoid any encroachment into the nature conservation area, which Friends of the Earth and the RSPB had objected to. Therefore, the new route of the link road should ensure that there are no objections. It was revealed on June that Edwina Hart, Minister for Economy, Science and Transport in the WAG supported the completion the Eastern Bay Link Road. She said that the link road would improve access to Cardiff Bay, improve access to the Cardiff Central Enterprise Zone and enhance connections within the Cardiff City Region. The overall objectives of the road would be to Increase accessibility from east Cardiff to major employment sites in the East Moors area, Cardiff Bay and the Central Cardiff Enterprise Zone Provide a more direct route between the Butetown Tunnel and Rover Way Help economic regeneration Provide more opportunities for cycling and walking The Queen s Gate Tunnel was featured in the first ever episode of Torchwood, called Everything Changes and was first broadcast by BBC Three on October. The Grangetown Link was featured in the Christmas episode of Doctor Who called The Runaway Bride. It was first broadcast by BBC One on December. The high profile and protracted five year development of Fez led to its status as an underdog darling of the indie game scene. The puzzle platform game built around rotating between four D views of a D space was developed by indie developer Polytron Corporation and published by Polytron, Trapdoor, and Microsoft Studios. Over the course of the game s development, Fez designer and Polytron founder Phil Fish received celebrity for his outspoken public persona and prominence in the documentary Indie Game The Movie, which followed the game s final stages of development and Polytron s related legal issues. The game was released to critical acclaim as an Xbox Live Arcade timed exclusive, and was later ported to other platforms. It had sold one million copies by the end of. Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, CBE March June was an English novelist. He was the son of an Anglican clergyman, intended for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged him were the authors Henry James and Arnold Bennett. His skill at scene setting and vivid plots, as well as his high profile as a lecturer, brought him a large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best selling author in the s and s but has been largely neglected since his death. As a gay man at a time when homosexual practices were illegal in Britain, Walpole conducted a succession of intense but discreet relationships with other men, and was for much of his life in search of what he saw as the perfect friend. He eventually found one, a married policeman, with whom he settled in the English Lake District. Having as a young man eagerly sought the support of established authors, he was in his later years a generous sponsor of many younger writers. He was a patron of the visual arts and bequeathed a substantial legacy of paintings to the Tate Gallery and other British institutions. The Sanitar is the part of the Red Cross that does the rough work at the front, carrying men out of the trenches, helping at the base hospitals in every sort of way, doing every kind of rough job. They are an absolutely official body and I shall be one of the few half dozen Englishmen in the world wearing Russian uniform. In his adopted home of Keswick a section of the town museum was dedicated to Walpole s memory in, with manuscripts, correspondence, paintings and sculpture from Brackenburn, donated by his sister and brother. In Priestley observed, If the Annals of Inisfallen is to be believed, Toirdelbach acquired possession of Dublin when the Dubliners themselves offered him its kingship. Although this record may be mere U Briain propaganda, it could instead reveal that the Dubliners preferred a distant overlord from Munster rather than one from neighbouring Leinster. Within the year, the kingship was held by Gofraid mac Amlab meic Ragnaill died. The latter appears to have been a kinsman of Echmarcach, and may well have been handed the kinship by Toirdelbach, perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms. Irresistible is the thirteenth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series The X Files. It premiered on the Fox network on January,. The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter, directed by David Nutter, and featured the first of two guest appearances by Nick Chinlund as the death fetishist killer Donnie Pfaster. The episode is a Monster of the Week story, a stand alone plot which is unconnected to the series wider mythology. The episode was viewed by. million people upon its first broadcast, and received positive reviews, with much praise to Chinlund s performance as the antagonist. Irresistible premiered on the Fox network on January,. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of., with a share, meaning that roughly. percent of all television equipped households, and percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by. million households. Chris Carter said Irresistible was effective for being really scary, and that not only it was one of his favorites but inspired him to create the television series Millennium later. Widely considered to be the Andersons most popular and commercially successful series, Thunderbirds has received particular praise for its effects directed by Derek Meddings and musical score composed by Barry Gray. It is also well remembered for its title sequence, which opens with an often quoted countdown by actor Peter Dyneley who voiced the character of Jeff,, Thunderbirds Are Go, A real life rescue service, the International Rescue Corps, is named after the organisation featured in the series. Thunderbird a single stage to orbit spacecraft. Piloted alternately by Alan and John, with Scott as co pilot. During the designing and filming process, Meddings first priorities were realism and credibility. With the exception of Thunderbird, each vehicle was built in three or four scales. Meddings swing wing concept for Thunderbird was inspired by his wish to create something more dynamic than a fixed wing aircraft. He remained unsatisfied with the prototype of Thunderbird until he inverted the wings, later commenting,... at the time, all aircraft had swept back wings. I only did it to be different. This decision was made out of personal preference and was not informed by any expert knowledge on Meddings part. He described the Thunderbird launch as probably the most memorable sequence that his team devised for an APF production. According to Daniel O Brien, writer of SF UK How British Science Fiction Changed the World, the Thunderbirds title sequence encapsulates the reasons for the series enduring popularity. Dyneley s countdown is particularly well remembered and has been widely quoted. Dean Newman of the Syfy channel website ranks Thunderbirds eighth in a list of Top TV title sequences, while Den of Geek s Martin Anderson considers the sequence the best of any TV series. Granada transmitted Thunderbirds in its original, minute format for the first time with the start of repeats in. In, the franchise briefly aired episodes in three parts due to timeslot restrictions. The availability of repeats during the s and s varied among regions. ATV Midlands screened the series regularly into the early s by contrast, Thunderbirds was entirely absent from Yorkshire Television between and. The series was last transmitted on the ITV franchises in. In, of the audio episodes released by APF Records were converted into radio dramas, which were transmitted on BBC Radio. The success of the radio series encouraged the BBC to acquire the rights to the TV episodes, which it broadcast simultaneously in all regions from September on BBC. Thunderbirds has been followed by two film sequels, a live action film adaptation, two animated TV remakes and several re edited presentations for TV broadcast and home video. The second of the remakes, Thunderbirds Are Go, premiered on ITV in, the th anniversary year of the original. In July, to celebrate the series th anniversary, Filmed in Supermarionation documentary director Stephen La Rivire launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds necessary to produce three new puppet episodes based on the Thunderbirds mini albums of the s. The project, titled Thunderbirds, is supported by ITV, Sylvia Anderson and the estate of Gerry Anderson. Partington and Carrington Youth Partnership was established to provide the town s youth with activities and the town has seen investment in a new youth centre. Broadoak School, the only secondary school in the town, is used by Trafford College to provide further education. As of the UK census,. of Partington s residents reported themselves as being Christian,. Muslim,. Hindu,. Jewish, and. Sikh. The census recorded. as having no religion,. had an alternative religion and. did not state their religion. The main shopping area of Partington is on Central Road, in the centre of town. Partington also has a traditional market on Smithy Lane. According to the UK census, the industry of employment of residents aged was. retail and wholesale,. manufacturing,. property and business services,. health and social work,. transport and communications,. construction,. education,. hotels and restaurants,. finance,. public administration,. agriculture,. energy and water supply,. mining, and. other. Compared with national figures, Partington had a relatively high percentage of residents working in transport and communications, and a relatively low percentage working in public administration. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged,. students were with jobs,. students without jobs,. looking after home or family,. permanently sick or disabled, and. economically inactive for other reasons. The proportion of those who were permanently sick or disabled in Partington was above the Trafford and England average. and. respectively. Trafford maintains a selective education system assessed by the Eleven Plus exam. There are three primary schools and one secondary school in Partington. The oldest school still standing in the town was opened in and used to be called Partington County Primary School. There is one other state primary schools at Forest Gate with Academy status. There is also a Roman Catholic school Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School on Lock Lane. Broadoak School is a secondary school with academy status for pupils aged to. The key, in all games, starting with FIBA s amendments to its rules in to be first implemented after the FIBA World Championship, is rectangular. Prior to, the key in FIBA sanctioned tournaments mostly basketball played outside the United States, and almost all international tournaments including the World Championships and the Olympics was trapezoidal in shape. Both NBA and FIBA keys are feet. m wide, while NCAA keys are narrower at feet. m. The most commonly enforced rule on the key is the three seconds rule in which a player from the offensive team is prohibited from staying on the key for more than three seconds, or else the player s team will lose possession of the ball. Another rule enforced is the lane violation in which players from both teams are prohibited to enter the lane until after the free throw shooter releases the ball from his hands the shooter is prohibited to enter the key until after the ball hits the rim. An innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player. The width of the key in the NBA is feet. m, including the foot. m wide foul lanes in U.S. college NCAA and high school play, it is feet. m. Beginning after the FIBA World Championship, all FIBA administered tournaments use a rectangular key. meters ft wide. From until, FIBA sanctioned tournaments used a trapezoidal key. The narrower end was on the free throw line, where it was. meters ft, while the wider end, at the end line, measured meters ft. Men s professional basketball in the United States notably the National Basketball Association widened it further to feet. m in the NBA season to lessen the effectiveness of centers, especially Wilt Chamberlain. The NCAA retains the feet key to this day. The lane is a restricted area in which players can stay for only a limited amount of time. On all levels, a team on the offensive in possession of the ball is prohibited to stay inside the lane for more than three seconds after three seconds the player will be called with a three second violation which will result in a turnover. When a player is shooting free throws, there are a certain number of players at the boundaries of the key, each occupying a slot traced at the boundaries of the key. In most cases, the free throw shooter is behind the free throw line, while three of his opponents are along the sides of the key, one side with two players, the other with one. Two of his opponents are situated nearest to the basket on both sides, while his two teammates are beside the two opponents closest to the basket, with the other player from the opposing team situated farthest from the basket. In the U.S. NCAA, there are as many as six players along the key, with the opposing team allowed to have as many as four players, with the same arrangement as in the NBA and FIBA but with another player facing his teammate farthest to the basket. See photographs to the right. No player along the lane may enter the key until the shot is released the player shooting the free throw, and anyone on top of the key, should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim. If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, if there are no more shots remaining, the ball is given to the defending team. If a defending player is in the lane too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed. The restricted area arc rule was implemented in NCAA men s basketball for the season. The NCAA approved adding a visible restricted area arc three feet from the center of the basket in Division I men s and women s games for season. The panel delayed implementation of the arc until the season for Divisions II and III to allow those schools time to plan and place the restricted area arc in their home arenas. Starting with the season, the NCAA raised the RA arc to four feet from the center of the basket. The intersection of the free throw line and the free throw lane is referred to as the elbow of the key. Its mixture of genres makes The General in His Labyrinth difficult to classify, and commentators disagree over where it lies on the scale between novel and historical account. Garca Mrquez s insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements some dealing with Bolvar s most intimate moments caused outrage in parts of Latin America when the book was released. Many prominent Latin American figures believed that the novel damaged the reputation of one of the region s most important historic figures and portrayed a negative image to the outside world. Others saw The General in His Labyrinth as a tonic for Latin American culture and a challenge to the region to deal with its problems. The novel is set in, at the tail end of the initial campaign to secure Latin America s independence from Spain. Most of Spanish America had gained independence by this date only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule. The early th century saw the first attempts at securing liberation from Spain, which were led in northern South America by Bolvar. He and the independence movements won numerous battles in Venezuela, New Granada and present day Ecuador and Peru. His dream of uniting the Spanish American nations under one central government was almost achieved. However, shortly after the South American colonies became independent of Spain, problems developed in the capitals, and civil wars were sparked in some provinces Bolvar lost many of his supporters and fell ill. Opposition to his presidency continued to increase, and in, after years of rule, he resigned as president of Gran Colombia. The General finally receives his passport, and two days later he sets off with his entourage for Cartagena and the coast, where more receptions are held in his honor. Throughout this time, he is surrounded by women but is too weak to engage in sexual relations. The General is deeply affected when he hears that his good friend and preferred successor for the presidency, Field Marshal Sucre, has been ambushed and assassinated. The General never leaves South America. He finishes his journey in Santa Marta, too weak to continue and with only his doctor and his closest aides by his side. He dies in poverty, a shadow of the man who liberated much of the continent. The leading character in the novel is the General, also called the Liberator. Garca Mrquez only once names his protagonist as Simn Bolvar, the famous historical figure, whose full title was General Simn Jos Antonio de la Santsima Trinidad Bolvar y Palacios, on whom the General s character is based. The novel s portrait of a national and Latin American hero, which challenges the historical record, provoked outrage in some quarters on its publication. The original Spanish version of The General in His Labyrinth was published simultaneously in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Spain in. The first American edition was listed as a best seller in The New York Times the following year. The city of Napa has historically not received as many wine country tourists as the cities north of it. A million flood management project around the turn of the st century to widen the Napa River and raise bridges prompted building developments. In the early s, a large development was completed in the downtown area, as well as several hotels. Copia and the nearby Oxbow Public Market were two large developments also constructed around that time to increase tourist and media focus on the city of Napa. The museum opened in, two months after the September attacks. The museum s visitor attendance was much lower than what was projected the museum partially attributed that to the depressed tourist economy stemming from the attacks. Writing about the failure of the project, The New York Times and other newspapers suggested that Copia had failed to clearly define its focus. Potential tourists were left feeling unsure whether they were visiting a museum, a cooking school, or a promotional center for wine. Museum attendance was initially forecast at, to compare, the county had. million tourists in., visitors attended in, visitors attended in, and, attended in., visitors attended in. The painting was bought in by Robert Vernon to form part of his collection of British art. Vernon donated his collection, including Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, to the National Gallery in, which, in turn, transferred it to the Tate Gallery in. It remains one of Etty s best known works, and formed part of major exhibitions at Tate Britain in and at the York Art Gallery in. Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm was inspired by a passage in Thomas Gray s poem The Bard. The theme of The Bard was the English king Edward I s conquest of Wales, and a curse placed by a Welsh bard upon Edward s descendants after he ordered the execution of all bards and the eradication of Welsh culture. Etty used a passage Gray intended to symbolise the seemingly bright start to the disastrous reign of Edward s great great grandson Richard II. Etty said of his approach to the text that he was hoping to create a general allegory of Human Life, its empty vain pleasures if not founded on the laws of Him who is the Rock of Ages. While Etty felt that the work conveyed a clear moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, this lesson was largely lost upon its audiences. Although it received little notice when first exhibited, the version provoked a strong reaction from The Times When Samuel Carter Hall was choosing works to illustrate his newly launched The Art Journal, he considered it important to promote new British artists, even if it meant illustrations which some readers considered pornographic or offensive. In Hall secured reproduction rights to the paintings Vernon had given to the nation and soon published and widely distributed an engraving of the painting under the title Youth and Pleasure, describing it as of the very highest class. Portugal s wars against independence guerrilla fighters in its year old African territories began in with Angola. In Mozambique, the conflict erupted in as a result of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous Mozambican populations, who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment, which served only to further Portuguese economic interests in the region. Many Mozambicans also resented Portugal s policies towards indigenous people, which resulted in discrimination, traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many Africans, and limited access to Portuguese style education and skilled employment. The United Nations also put pressure on Portugal to move for decolonisation. Portugal threatened to withdraw from NATO, which put a stop to this support and pressure, and the nationalist groups in Mozambique were forced to turn to help from the Soviet bloc. Prior to the formation of FRELIMO, the Soviet position regarding the nationalist movements in Mozambique was one of confusion. There were multiple independence movements, and they had no sure knowledge that any would succeed. The nationalist groups in Mozambique, like those across Africa during the period, received training and equipment from the Soviet Union. One seventh of the population and one fifth of the territory were in FRELIMO hands by at this time there were approximately guerrillas in combat. During this period, Mondlane urged further expansion of the war effort, but also sought to retain the small strike groups. With the increasing cost of supply, more and more territory liberated from the Portuguese, and the adoption of measures to win the support of the population, it was at this time that Mondlane sought assistance from abroad, specifically the Soviet Union and China from these benefactors, he obtained large calibre machine guns, anti aircraft rifles and mm recoilless rifles and mm rockets. In, the second Congress of FRELIMO was a propaganda victory for the insurgents, despite attempts by the Portuguese, who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict, to bomb the location of the meeting late in the day. This gave FRELIMO further weight to wield in the United Nations. There were several Portuguese special forces units that were unique to either the Mozambican conflict or the Portuguese Colonial War as a whole Special Groups Grupos Especiais units similar to the ones used in Angola The Secret of Monkey Island is a point and click graphic adventure game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games. It takes place in a fantastic version of the Caribbean during the age of piracy. The player assumes the role of Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles. Critics praised The Secret of Monkey Island for its humor, audiovisuals, and gameplay. The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the Monkey Island series. Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman also led the development of the sequel Monkey Island LeChuck s Revenge. LucasArts released a remake of the original in, which was also well received by the gaming press. The Secret of Monkey Island is a D adventure game played from a third person perspective. Via a point and click interface, the player guides protagonist Guybrush Threepwood through the game s world and interacts with the environment by selecting from twelve verb commands nine in newer versions such as talk to for communicating with characters and pick up for collecting items between commands and the world s objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game. While conversing with other characters, the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed in a dialog tree the game is one of the first to incorporate such a system. The in game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes. Like other LucasArts adventure games, The Secret of Monkey Island features a design philosophy that makes the player character s death nearly impossible Guybrush does drown if he stays underwater for more than ten minutes. The game s plot, as described by Dave Grossman It s a story about this young man who comes to an island in search of his life s dream. He s pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with. You re laughing, but there s actually something deeper going on as well. When work on the plot began, Gilbert discovered that Schafer s and Grossman s writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole Grossman s was very kind of a dry, sarcastic humor and Schafer s was just a little more in your face. In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required. Grossman believed that this benefited the game s writing, as he and Schafer were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together. Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game as a result, much of it was improvised. Some of the dialogue was based on the designers personal experiences, such as Guybrush s line I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms, which came from Schafer s own hatred of fungi. The Eshmun sanctuary was damaged by an earthquake in the fourth century BC, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed at the base of the podium. The temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the classical antiquity during the early Roman Empire and until the advent of Christianity, when the cult of Eshmun was banned and a Christian church was built at the temple site across the Roman street from the podium. Remnants and mosaic floors of a Byzantine church can still be seen on the site. The Eshmun Temple complex comprises an elaborate hydraulic installation channeling water from Ydll spring that is made up of an intricate system of water canals, a series of retaining basins, sacred ablution basins and paved pools. This system demonstrates the importance of ritual ablutions in Phoenician therapeutic cults. In Busch returned several times to Munich, and took part in the intense life of the Munich Art Society as an escape from provincial life. In, in a last attempt to be a serious artist, he took a studio in Munich. He left Munich abruptly in, after he disrupted a variety show and subsequently made a scene through the effects of alcohol The nine episode illustrated tale Eight Sheets in the Wind describes how humans behave like animals when drunk. Busch s biographer Weissweiler felt the story was only superficially funny and harmless, but was a study on addiction and its induced state of delusion. Residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features. It highlights Plensa s themes of dualism, light, and water, extending the use of video technology from his prior works. Its use of water is unique among Chicago s many fountains, in that it promotes physical interaction between the public and the water. Both the fountain and Millennium Park are highly accessible because of their universal design. In December, Lester Crown and his family agreed to sponsor a water feature in Millennium Park. Unlike other park feature sponsors, the Crowns acted independently of Millennium Park officials they conducted independent surveys of water technologies, held their own informal design contest, and stayed active in the design and engineering of the project. The Crown family, for whom the fountain is named, donated million of the million construction and design cost. The Goodman family, known for funding the Goodman Theatre, was also a large contributor the entire million cost was provided by private donations. The initial proposed cost for the fountain had been million. Construction of the video sculpture was completed for testing without the fountain s water features on May,. Originally, Plensa had planned to have each face appear for minutes, and this continued to be the targeted duration when the testing of the sculpture occurred. Eventually, professors at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago convinced him to use only five minute videos. Plensa s design of Crown Fountain was unveiled to the public on July, during the grand opening celebrations for Millennium Park, which was sponsored by J.P. Morgan Chase Co. At the time of the unveiling, Crown Fountain, like the nearby Cloud Gate, was incomplete because only of the videos had been refined for public display. It was officially dedicated on July, as part of a special private fundraising party that raised million for the Millennium Park Conservancy fund. Each tower is illuminated from within on three sides by approximately color changing Color Kinetics LED lighting fixtures per tower, while the fourth side features opposing Barco LED display screens. At night, some of the videos are replaced by images of nature or solid colors. Also at night, the other three sides of the fountain display changing colors. The outer Color Kinetics surfaces randomly display the translucent glow of one of eight colors along with each of the inner opposing faces. As a video sculpture with a variety of cascade and water spout fountain modes, the sculpture is a fluid, dynamic evolving artwork. Development of the Canning River as a source of water for Perth was first proposed in a report of the first Metropolitan Water Works Board of Perth in. Investigation of the site began in when engineer Thomas Hodgson surveyed and proposed the dam s current location as a possible site. However, despite the recommendations of further inquiries, and an extreme shortage of water in some years, government funds were not allocated for the construction of a dam until the Great Depression in the s. The Canning Dam and reservoir still supplies approximately percent of Perth s drinking water requirements and plays an important role in the context of the development of Perth. The construction of Canning Dam ended a long period during which Perth s water supply was generally unsatisfactory in quality either due to salinity or bacterial pollution or both and in quantity. The project, the biggest public works program of the decade, stimulated significant growth in the local economy and provided desperately needed work for around five hundred men. Several innovative design concepts and construction methods which were new to Australia were introduced on the project, while others which were used on the nearby Wellington Dam, were improved upon at the Canning dam site. The final cost of the dam was significantly less than had been originally budgeted for, and the work was completed on schedule to a date that was calculated seven years previously. Midge was re introduced in as part of the play line, though two vintage reproduction dolls were made specifically for collectors in and. The dolls sold in this time period usually had red hair, often with freckles, and her eye color was usually blue. Also in the period, Wedding Day Midge was sold, with the groom being Alan Sherwood, who had been marketed as Midge s boyfriend in the vintage years. Midge and Alan had three children introduced named Ryan, Nikki, and Cassandra. They also had twins who were never introduced. This was known as the Happy Family line, and in the set, Midge was sold pregnant with Nikki as a newborn baby. The Happy Family product became the subject of controversy when some parents disliked the pregnant Midge toy because they believed that Midge was too young to have children. The year after Midge and Alan were married, a picture of the couple with twin babies was shown in a pamphlet, but the dolls were never produced. However, in, she and Alan were re introduced with a family consisting of them and three different kids, three year old Ryan, and newborn baby Nikki. This was known as the Happy Family line, and was similar to the discontinued Heart Family line of the s. The dolls came in both European American and African American versions. This was the first time an African American Midge was ever produced. Midge s first appearance was made with her own headmold, Vintage Midge Before Teresa made her debut, Midge used Steffie headmold Midge comes and goes so many times, but with her th birthday, she returns with the Steffie headmold Joseph Bruce vocals, composer Shaggy Dope vocals, scratching Mike E.

Very low mass stars, with masses below. M, are fully convective and distribute helium evenly throughout the whole star while on the main sequence. Therefore, they never undergo shell burning, never become red giants, which cease fusing and become helium white dwarfs and slowly cool after exhausting their hydrogen. However, as the lifetime of. M stars is longer than the age of the universe, no such star has yet reached the white dwarf stage. Low mass stars including the Sun, with a mass between. M and.. M depending on composition, do become red giants as their core hydrogen is depleted and they begin to burn helium in core in a helium flash they develop a degenerate carbon oxygen core later on the asymptotic giant branch they finally blow off their outer shell as a planetary nebula and leave behind their core in the form of a white dwarf. Massive stars generally have a minimum mass of M possibly as low as M. After exhausting the hydrogen at the core these stars become supergiants and go on to fuse elements heavier than helium. They end their lives when their cores collapse and they explode as supernovae. Stars spend about of their existence fusing hydrogen into helium in high temperature and high pressure reactions near the core. Such stars are said to be on the main sequence, and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a star s core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the star s temperature and luminosity. The Sun, for example, is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about since it reached the main sequence. billion. years ago. Every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space. For most stars, the mass lost is negligible. The Sun loses M every year, or about. of its total mass over its entire lifespan. However, very massive stars can lose to M each year, significantly affecting their evolution. Stars that begin with more than M can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence. Besides mass, the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars. Astronomers label all elements heavier than helium metals, and call the chemical concentration of these elements in a star, its metallicity. A star s metallicity can influence the time the star takes to burn its fuel, and controls the formation of its magnetic fields, which affects the strength of its stellar wind. Older, population II stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger, population I stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed. Over time, such clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their atmospheres. As stars of at least. M exhaust their supply of hydrogen at their core, they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the helium core. Their outer layers expand and cool greatly as they form a red giant. In about billion years, when the Sun enters the helium burning phase, it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly astronomical unit million kilometres, times its present size, and lose of its current mass. During their helium burning phase, stars of more than nine solar masses expand to form red supergiants. When this fuel is exhausted at the core, they continue to fuse elements heavier than helium. As a star s core shrinks, the intensity of radiation from that surface increases, creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a planetary nebula. If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than. M, it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth, known as a white dwarf. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The electron degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma, even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long period of time. The blown off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements, which may be recycled during the formation of new stars. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets. The outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium. In addition to isolated stars, a multi star system can consist of two or more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit our Milky Way galaxy. It has been a long held assumption that the majority of stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where of the stars are believed to be part of multiple star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth. Due to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars are thought to be rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs. Almost everything about a star is determined by its initial mass, including such characteristics as luminosity, size, evolution, lifespan, and its eventual fate. The more massive the star, the shorter its lifespan, primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass red dwarfs burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years. When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about hydrogen and helium, as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure. The portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system. The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its proper motion. The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star s spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines. The stellar temperature will determine the rate of ionization of various elements, resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum. The surface temperature of a star, along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features, is used to classify a star see classification below. Massive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of, K. Smaller stars such as the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about, K but they also have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area. The production of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star s outer layers. Relative to both luminosity and distance from Earth, a star s absolute magnitude M and apparent magnitude m are not equivalent for example, the bright star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of., but it has an absolute magnitude of.. The Sun has an apparent magnitude of., but its absolute magnitude is only.. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky as seen from Earth, is approximately times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of., is approximately, times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely. light years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of light years. The interior of a stable star is in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star. As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit energy in the form of gamma rays. These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than. M, fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core. In addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below. The photosphere is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer. This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light. From here, the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space. It is within the photosphere that sun spots, regions of lower than average temperature, appear. The hydrogen fusion process is temperature sensitive, so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate. As a result, the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from million kelvin for a small M class star to million kelvin for a massive O class star. In the Sun, with a million kelvin core, hydrogen fuses to form helium in the proton proton chain reaction These reactions result in the overall reaction In evolved stars with cores at million kelvin and masses between. and M, helium can be transformed into carbon in the triple alpha process that uses the intermediate element beryllium He He keV Be He Be keV C For an overall reaction of The example below shows the amount of time required for a star of M to consume all of its nuclear fuel. As an O class main sequence star, it would be times the solar radius and, times the Sun s luminosity. Perry was made a platypus because of the animal s striking appearance and the lack of public knowledge of the animal, which allowed the writers to make things up about the species. Critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans have been considerably positive. Merchandising of the character include plush toys, t shirts, wooden toys, glasses, and coloring books, along with appearances in literature and a video game for the Nintendo DS. Amylostereum is the single genus in the fungal family Amylostereaceae. The genus currently comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or dead wood. The Amylostereaceae cause white rot in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin. They produce crust like, partially wavy fruit bodies on the surface of infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species. With the exception of A. laevigatum, all species have a thin separating layer, the cortex, between the hymenium and the tomentum. A cortex is also present on many Stereum fungi on a broader front and serves to bend up the fruit body. As this cortex is missing on A. laevigatum, its fruit body lies flat on the bark. From the early s Alkan began to turn his attention seriously to the pedal piano pdalier. Alkan gave his first public performances on the pdalier to great critical acclaim in. From onwards he began to publish pieces designated as for organ or piano pdalier. However, not all of Alkan s music is either lengthy or technically difficult for example, many of the Op. Prludes and of the set of Esquisses, Op.. Moreover, in terms of structure, Alkan in his compositions sticks to traditional musical forms, although he often took them to extremes, as he did with piano technique. The study Op., no. the first movement of the Concerto for solo piano takes almost half an hour in performance.

Meanwhile, a bat becomes trapped in the office, leading Dwight and Creed on a mission to protect the employees. A road bearing the M designation has existed since at least July, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it has been extended, rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by the highway was fully paved in the s. A change made in was reversed in, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the s was overturned in the s. The last change was the construction of a pair of roundabouts at the I US interchange in. The common starling has about a dozen subspecies breeding in open habitats across its native range in temperate Europe and western Asia, and it has been introduced to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, the Falkland Islands, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, South Africa and Fiji. This bird is resident in southern and western Europe and southwestern Asia, while northeastern populations migrate south and west in winter within the breeding range and also further south to Iberia and North Africa. The common starling builds an untidy nest in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy, pale blue eggs are laid. These take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks. There are normally one or two breeding attempts each year. This species is omnivorous, taking a wide range of invertebrates, as well as seeds and fruit. It is hunted by various mammals and birds of prey, and is host to a range of external and internal parasites. Large flocks typical of this species can be beneficial to agriculture by controlling invertebrate pests however, starlings can also be pests themselves when they feed on fruit and sprouting crops. Common starlings may also be a nuisance through the noise and mess caused by their large urban roosts. Introduced populations in particular have been subjected to a range of controls, including culling, but these have had limited success except in preventing the colonisation of Western Australia. The species has declined in numbers in parts of northern and western Europe since the s due to fewer grassland invertebrates being available as food for growing chicks. Despite this, its huge global population is not thought to be declining significantly, so the common starling is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Subspecies In Iberia, the western Mediterranean and northwest Africa, the common starling may be confused with the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range it can be seen that the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings. The common starling has been introduced to and has successfully established itself in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, North America, Fiji and several Caribbean islands. As a result, it has also been able to migrate to Thailand, Southeast Asia and New Guinea. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red tipped, while those of H. gammarus are white or white tipped. The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red, while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red. The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is European lobster, but the species is also widely known as the common lobster. Among the city s many arts organizations and historic buildings are the Riley Center, the Meridian Museum of Art, Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian was home to two Carnegie libraries, one for whites and one for African Americans. The Carnegie Branch Library, now demolished, was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in the Southern United States during the segregation era.

Overview of population trends Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood, Angel of Death is featured on all of Slayer s live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies. The song was well received by critics Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a classic. The lyrical content of Angel of Death contributed to the delay of the release of Slayer s album Reign in Blood. The band were signed to Def Jam Records whose distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns, deeming the artwork too graphic. Reign in Blood was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October,. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records official release schedule.

The complex dates to AD. Altar is associated with Stela and bears the sculpture of a bound captive. It is located in front of Temple VI. Stela was found in the summit shrine of Temple, underneath a broken masonry altar. The monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken, probably at the beginning of the Late Classic. Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine. Stela is paired with Altar. It is a plain monument at the base of the stairway of Temple IV. The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion, but a commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism whose totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany s democratic society. Accordingly, the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization. Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology in France, the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October, after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products, and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether. Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium, Greece and the UK.

Regardless, the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however, and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments. When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War, the Australian government rapidly followed suit, with Prime Minister Joseph Cook declaring on August that... when the Empire is at war, so also is Australia and reflecting the sentiment of many Australians that any declaration of war by Britain automatically included Australia. This was itself in part due to the large number of British born citizens and first generation Anglo Australians that made up the Australian population at the time. Indeed, by the end of the war almost of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain. The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the Japanese would invade the Australian mainland. While elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy proposed this in early, it was judged to be impossible by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. This fact was not known by the Allies at the time, and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion. Large numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early, and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March. Australia also provided artillery and engineer support, along with an air field construction squadron. The Royal Australian Navy also served in Malayan waters, firing on suspected communist positions between and. The Emergency was the longest continued commitment in Australian military history, Australians served and died in Malaya although only were on operations and another were wounded. Until the s, Australia s military strategy centred on the concept of Forward Defence, in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia s region. Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the United States in, and the British withdrawal east of Suez in the early s, Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self reliance and the defence of the Australian continent. Known as the Defence of Australia Policy, it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation s northern maritime approaches the air sea gap against possible attack.

Ken Sachs The Finger keyboard Sonny Mayo guitar Studio albums Back Base X Truth Rising Evolution Forever, The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo, which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the s the term ironclad dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers. The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the th century. According to naval historian J. Richard Hill The ironclad had three chief characteristics a metal skinned hull, steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells. It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad. Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads. Steam powered screw frigates were built in the mid s, and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle. The desire for change came from the ambition of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe, which required a challenge to the British at sea. The first purpose built steam battleship was the gun Napolon in. Napolon was armed as a conventional ship of the line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of knots km h, regardless of the wind conditions a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. By the end of the s it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required. The result was the first ocean going ironclad, the Gloire, begun in and launched in. The ram finally fell out of favour in the s, as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo, with less vulnerability to quick firing guns. The first British, French and Russian ironclads, in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line, carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called broadside ironclads. Both Gloire and HMS Warrior were examples of this type. Because their armor was so heavy, they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck. The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple expansion steam engine, a further refinement which was first adopted in HMS Sans Pareil, laid down in and commissioned in. Many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines, and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid s decade. There were many types of ironclads A number of ironclads have been preserved or reconstructed as museum ships. HMS Warrior is today a fully restored museum ship in Portsmouth, England The hull of the casemate ironclad CSS Jackson can be seen in the National Civil War Naval Museum at Port Columbus, Georgia. Search party all Jewish with family ties to the Holocaust, except for John Asher This book is the only work of fiction by Steiner to have been adapted for the stage. The book generated considerable controversy because of its apparent admiration for Hitler. The controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation too faithful, according to Steiner was performed in the United Kingdom and the United States. Hitler s speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics. Steiner not only lets Hitler justify his past, he allows him the almost last word before the outside world invades. The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious. One critic, while acknowledging that Steiner always saw Hitler as the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil, felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between Steiner s own views and those of his fictional Hitler, even going so far as to accuse Steiner, who rejects Jewish nationalism and is a critic of Israel s treatment of the Palestinians, of anti Semitism.

In the late s, there was increasing rebellion against the rule of Somali President Siad Barre, a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses. By, what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war, with several militias organized to overthrow the central government. An increasing level of criminal violence prompted Ambassador Bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents e.g. children and spouses of staff and non essential staff in early December, although fighting between the government and the United Somali Congress a rebel militia remained no less than about miles km away. The voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation. By December, the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from to around the same time, fighting between the government and rebels came within about miles km of Mogadishu.

The War Office put their order on hold in a post Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks, due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle. Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks, light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour, were nevertheless deployed against them the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re evaluate the suitability of the light tank design. The pre war role of the light tank, that of reconnaissance, meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross country abilities. Further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the Luftwaffe during May against the factories where the tanks were assembled. West Valley City, Utah.

Only if Germany was defeated within their first year would they be released. Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it, the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar. This town inside the Rock contained its own power station, water supply, and hospital. Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end. Two Canadian engineer companies, the only soldiers with diamond tipped drills and British engineer companies, added some miles km of such tunnels, a feat thought impossible at the time. That was enough to hold all, troops on the rock. Today, the rock has more underground tunnels than roads. Military history of the British Commonwealth in the Second World War Cast notes
